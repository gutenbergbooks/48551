<h2><em>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</em></h2>


<p><em>"It is merely a question of head," said Percy Anderson to me
one day, whilst we were discussing some easy method of
solving a problem in fancy dress.</em></p>

<p><em>And he continued:</em></p>

<p><em>"Indeed, I would say that, broadly speaking, of all
costume. The fashion of any period is distinguished primarily
by the way its wearer dresses her hair."</em></p>

<p><em>"And chooses her sleeves," I suggested, and received his
approval.</em></p>

<p><em>We agreed then that we were both most keenly interested
in dress, regarding it as one of the fine and essential arts;
and we decided that we would try to preach its best doctrines
and traditions to the world at large, while we did not ignore
the fact that many more worthy had previously enriched
literature with the same object. Realising this most acutely,
it came to pass that I found myself searching libraries for
information which could serve to point my moral, while Mr.
Anderson consented to adorn my tale and help me in my endeavour
to present concisely, and with as little ceremony and
as much simplicity as possible, the main facts of the fashions
which have obtained through the centuries.</em></p>

<p><em>A few practical details and suggestions are included in the
hope that they may obviate some difficulties of those who fret
their hour on the stage or at the fancy-dress ball, while, for
the benefit of the next generation, I have devoted a small space
to personal reminiscences of theatrical heroes and heroines, and
to some facts of theatrical dress, as it has been expressed in
classic and popular dramas produced by the leading actors and
actresses of our time.</em></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="p5">IN CLASSIC TIMES</p>


<p>Fashion, even under exalted patronage, had scant chance to distinguish
herself in the bad old days of the Romans. She, who now must be obeyed,
was forced then to take a back seat enwrapped in the toga, and all who
would have preached or practised the doctrine of diversified dress
remained mute, inglorious modistes. It is not on record that any great
personage invented any particular garment, or was accorded the honour of
standing godmother to a favoured style. Such privileges as those of Queen
Alexandra, who, at the indiscretion of any draper, may be sponsor to a
ruffle or a petticoat, or of Queen Victoria Eug√©nie, whose name has been
snatched to honour a face-cream, were not in vogue. This seems a pity
when one comes to consider the alliterative allurement of such a title as
the "Boadicean blouse," and to remember that the "Popp√¶an pomade," which
might have been justified in the observance, was deliberately committed
in the breach.</p>

<p>There was sorry opportunity for any who would
have liked to stamp individuality on their costume.
Style was a cut-and-dried affair, and save in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
elaboration or simplicity of adornment variety was practically without
the pale. There was but subtle distinction between the form of the tunic
and the stola, yet perchance in the deftness of the adjustment of the
drapery of the toga and the exact position of the girdle, taste could
play some part. But the world of costume was a dull table-land exalted to
a scene of battle only when the stringent laws relating to extravagances
were liberally disregarded. It seems to have been a custom throughout the
ages for some historian, ruler, or priest to interfere with the existing
facts of fashion. One can find traces of such want of sympathy even in
the eighteenth century. The Roman laws were arbitrary, and Numa actually
forbade any woman to have more than half an ounce of gold on her robes,
while he also prohibited the garment of many colours. It is pleasing,
however, to realise that his strictures were not taken very seriously.</p>

<p>The one sartorial fact with which my youthful mind was burdened was
that the earliest Britons stained their tattooed bodies with woad.
Chroniclers are not in accord as to the precise shade of this blue
dye, proving that the habits of chroniclers change but little, since
fashion-writers of to-day may be accused of like conduct; and as woad
is more correctly described as an undress uniform than as an article
of clothing, I will not now discuss the question of its exact colour,
but note contentedly that all authorities agree that the Britons
clad themselves in skins decorated with beads and flowers, which, in
conjunction with their painted and punctured persons, lent them a
ferocious aspect, quite attractive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Much as Boadicea detested the Romans, she preferred their graceful
garments to those worn by her own countrywomen, and when she led her
troops into battle, she was attired in all the glory of a multi-coloured
tunic, and her hair fell unbound over her neck and shoulders. Wily
Boadicea, her unbound hair proved the woman in the warrior, who would win
her triumph as best she could, though history is careful not to attribute
to her any but the most legitimate methods!</p>

<p>In those days the Roman women made a rule of wearing a toga, which,
hanging from the neck or the head, fell over the shoulders and touched
the ground at the back. The toga was either white or yellow for persons
of rank, when the border was purple, but the lower orders had the toga
dyed, and in times of mourning chose it in black. Within doors the toga
was discarded altogether in favour of the simple tunic, which was worn
with or without the girdle, and made either of woollen material or cotton
or thin gauze. Towards the latter part of the Empire the tunic was
lengthened, and bore sleeves adorned with buttons according to Hellenic
fashion; indeed, the sleeve seemed then, as now, to indicate style, for
the earlier types reached only to the elbow, and gradually they extended
to the wrist, and finally to the ground.</p>

<p>When the stola became popular it was always white, bearing long
sleeves ornamented with a wide border, and over it fell a mantle with a
hood round the shoulders. White was the favourite colour for a long time,
and even in those days the Gauls inspired the fashions. They taught the
Britons to spin and weave and dye, and purple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and scarlet herb dyes were employed with considerable success, though
the chief colouring matter was woad. The Roman women allowed their taste
in colour to run riot, and purple, scarlet, green, yellow, hyacinth, and
blue were all in favour, as well as chequered materials.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_b_004.jpg" width="109" height="200" alt="" title="A Hand Mirror" />
<div class="caption"><p>A HAND-MIRROR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The foot-gear at this period was of two kinds, either reaching to the
middle of the leg and covering the whole foot, or only protecting the
sole of the foot and being secured by leather thongs. Women's shoes were
but little less costly than those worn by the men, and were gay with
ornament of gold set with pearls and other precious stones.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_b_004a.jpg" width="113" height="150" alt="" title="A Hand Mirror a" />
<div class="caption"><p>A HAND-MIRROR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Jewellery was a great feature; ear-rings, bracelets, armlets, torques
and necklaces, and rings of gold, silver, and baser metals, were often
set with precious stones, or engraved with the portrait of some dear
friend or the representation of some historical event. Such rings, being
used for sealing letters and documents, would usually be bequeathed by
a Roman on his death-bed to his nearest friend. Ear-rings were a very
favourite form of adornment, and three or four would dangle picturesquely
from each ear, but only women and boys wore them. The wearing of rings,
however, was general. Iron, copper, and ivory played their part in the
making of the bracelets, and in the long pins for the hair, which were
decorated with massive heads mostly significant, including such odd
designs as a fish bearing in its mouth two precious stones, and a hanging
basket with a greedy bird pecking at its floral contents. The serpent
found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
his way to favour as an armlet and again as a diadem. The Greeks, indeed,
were fond of adorning their garments with beasts and birds, which they
embroidered or wove in gold and silver and coloured threads.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_005fp.jpg" width="427" height="600" alt="" title="In Ancient Greece" />
<div class="caption"><p>IN ANCIENT GREECE.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_005fpa.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>The Greek female dress consisted of the pallium, a cloak-like garment
very long and ample, worn plain, or bearing a fringed border, and under
this was a chlamys, bearing close kinship in form to the Roman toga,
and fastened to the shoulder by a brooch. The Grecian women cut their
hair close to their heads, and the married were distinguished from the
unmarried by a parting in front, but no Grecian woman ever went without a
veil, covering the face. The head-dress and ribbons of matrons differed
from those of the virgins, and there was a change in the shape of the
tunic before and after marriage. Ribbons in the hair were preferred as
decorations by the modest women, while the courtesans covered their heads
with a mitre, and carried oval hand-mirrors, which distinguished them, as
it were significantly, from their more virtuous sisters, who made use of
fans of leaves or feathers.</p>

<p>The art of beauty, it seems, was studied with much interest. The use
of cosmetics was greatly favoured. White lead was employed to whiten the
skin, and vermilion to produce the rosy bloom of youth; and we have most
of us been impressed by the fact that Nero's wife discovered a pomade for
the preservation of her complexion&mdash;no doubt her urgent needs led to
this heroic effort! Much time and attention were bestowed on the hair,
and the use of false tresses was very general, slaves being employed to
curl the hair, while experts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
supervised the process. The structures were adorned with pearls and
other precious stones, crowns of gold and flowers, ribbons and fillets,
while the embroidered net, known as the caul, also had a full share of
patronage. The Roman women would paint their hair a gorgeous yellow.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_b_006.jpg" width="300" height="296" alt="" title="A Roman Head" />
<div class="caption"><p>A ROMAN HEAD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Men and women alike wore the cothurnus, which reached to the knee,
where it was fastened, purple being the favourite colour for this. It
could not have been possible to obtain a great variety in a costume, and,
save in the decoration of the tunic, which was ornamented with spots or
scrolls, and in the arrangement of the girdle, of two varying widths,
the one placed above the other so that the folds of the gown could pouch
between, every one must have appeared very like his brother and his
sister.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_b_006b.jpg" width="300" height="317" alt="" title="A Greek Head" />
<div class="caption"><p>A GREEK HEAD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the divergences in the fashion of the tunic worn by the women
and that worn by the men was in the former always reaching to the feet
and covering the arms.</p>

<p>The actual shape of the garments varied but little, and between the
tunic and the stola there would have been some difficulty in seeing any
difference, but the stola was worn over the tunic, and it came as low
as the ankles, and was fastened round the body by a girdle, broad folds
being above the breast: the essential distinction between the two in cut
being that the stola always possessed an instita or flounce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_007.jpg" width="352" height="600" alt="" title="A Roman Lady" />
<div class="caption"><p>A ROMAN LADY.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a curious fact, and one worthy of note, that the dress of the
boys was marked by a change after the age of seventeen. Then they laid
aside the purple-bordered toga in favour of the toga purely white, white
being, presumably, the insignia of liberty. Boys wore, too, about their
necks a hollow ball or boss, the higher classes having this in gold, and
the poorer citizens in leather. This boss was also adopted as an ornament
for belts or girdles, but in the very ancient days the Roman men had no
other clothing than the toga, and it was thought effeminate to appear
abroad carelessly girdled.</p>

<p>The Romans in later days wore a chiton, a short woollen shirt without
sleeves, and they also bestowed patronage upon long linen garments
bearing sleeves, while above the toga they adopted a sort of coat, open
in front and fastened with clasps and buckles, this sharing favour with
the greatcoat or surtout, which bore a hood and was chiefly used for
journeys or by the soldiers. The military robe proper of the Romans was
a woollen garment called a sagum, and the men at first wore neither
stockings nor breeches, but enwrapped their legs and thighs with pieces
of cloth. Later they tried socks of goat's hair and shoes of unwrought
leather.</p>

<p>The shoes of the senators flaunted a gold crest on the top, and black
was the most general colour, though scarlet and red were also in use.</p>

<p>Gloves too were amongst the possibilities of
this early moment, and it is set down that some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
these were cut with fingers, and that others were of the pattern of a
mitten.</p>

<p>In grief the Romans allowed their hair to grow, even as the Jews did,
and the first growth of the beard in youth was consecrated to some god.
The hair was treated altogether with much respect, valued and considered
with care. Every lady of distinction possessed her own hair-dresser,
curling irons were in demand, and a popular shape of head-dressing was
copied from the helmet.</p>

<p>For the rest, let my illustrations speak. The coloured specimen
represents the classic Greek garb under its simplest aspect, made in
white home-spun bordered with yellow, and falling in folds somewhat
disguiseful to the figure, and quite simple to achieve. The Roman
lady having flattered the Grecian sleeve to the point of imitation,
proudly bears her toga traced with purple and crowned with jewels.
The two head-dresses are characteristic, and amongst things easy to
understand.</p>

<p>Taking the so-called classic period altogether, it must be admitted
that among the ancient Greeks and Romans were born the best principles of
the art of dress&mdash;an appreciation of outline and a sense of grace in
drapery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="p5">IN EARLY MEDI√ÜVAL TIMES</p>


<p>From the days of the early Britons to the twelfth century is a long
jump, but in many countries the growth of new fashions was so slow that
to attempt to describe it would mean much wearying repetition and an
unnecessary extension of these pages.</p>

<p>For example, the dress worn by the men and women of Italy during
the twelfth century was very similar to the old Roman styles, while in
Southern Italy the Norman dress found favour as well as the Byzantine. In
Sicily Arab costume predominated, and in Northern Italy the German and
the Norman fashions shared popularity. Italian women, who all aspired to
express their exalted birth by their dress, wore in the house a tunic
or stola drawn up under a belt to show the feet, fitting closely to the
figure and bearing long or short sleeves, as fancy dictated, and over
this a palla, developed into a rectangular piece of cloth, passed under
the right armpit with the ends knotted on the left shoulder.</p>

<p>Until the close of the tenth century, costume in England bore more
resemblance to that worn in ancient Rome than to any chosen by the Danes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Though the Normans were greatly influenced by the Saracenic and Byzantine
fashions prevailing in Southern Europe, an English lady of the twelfth
century could scarcely have been distinguished by her attire from a lady
of the Lower Empire, or even a modern maid of Athens; and no doubt a
contemporary wit of flippant habit would have excused her simplicity by
declaring that the study of costume was Greek to her.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>A DRESS LACED AT THE BACK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The prevailing note in dress in the twelfth century was costliness.
The king set the fashion of rich apparel, and his example was followed
by both clergy and people, though the former exercised their didactic
privileges by inveighing against the most popular eccentricities. The
women's dress at this period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
showed a strong tendency to exaggerated length, and the veils and
kerchiefs were so long that the fair wearers were forced to knot them
to avoid treading on them, while the skirts lay in great folds on the
ground. Much significance might be attached to that precious old MS.
where the illuminator depicts the devil in a woman's <em>surcoat</em> with a
sleeve and skirts tied up in knots! Robes were laced up in front, and the
cuffs of the sleeves embroidered or fur-trimmed, and over the long robe
or tunic appeared a shorter garment resembling the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sur c√¥te</i>, which was
chequered and spotted, presumably to represent embroidery, and finished
with an indented border termed "dagged," in a fashion condemned by Henry
II. Norman ladies wore their hair plaited, the braids often incased in
silk or bound round with ribbon and finished off with three curls; but
towards the end of the twelfth century the hair was frequently held in a
network of gold set with stones.</p>

<p>The clergy had much to say on the subject of the long beards which
reappeared during the reign of Henry I.; and that one, more forcible
than elegant in his denunciations, who described the men of his time as
"filthy goats," has for the solecism gone down to posterity with the
priest who, preaching such a moving sermon on the subject that king and
courtiers wept, took advantage of the impression he had made, drew out a
large pair of scissors that he had concealed in his sleeve, and cropped
the entire assemblage.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_012fp.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="" title="In the Twelfth Century" />
<div class="caption"><p>IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_012fpa.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>During the latter half of the twelfth century a change for the
better came over the spirit of dress, which was now marked by a greater
reticence. The extravagant cuff disappeared, and sleeves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
worn tight and fastened at the wrist. An effigy of Queen Berengaria, in
the Abbey of l'Espan, shows the queen with flowing locks partly covered
by a kerchief, surmounted by a gold crown; her robe is held together at
the neck by a large circular brooch set with precious stones, her mantle
hanging almost to her feet behind, while a small aum√¥ni√®re is pendent
from a beautiful girdle. For just so much detail and no more would I pin
my faith to a monumental sculptor as a fashion historian. Green was the
favourite colour of the robe in the reign of John, and there is a king's
warrant for two green robes for the queen, each to consist of two ells
of cloth, while there exists a register showing that a green robe lined
with condal cost sixty shillings; so common, in fact, was the wearing of
the green that Longchamp, the arrogant Bishop of Ely, when he was forced
to fly the kingdom to escape John's rage, disguised himself in a woman's
green tunic and Norman mantle and hood of the same colour.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_b_013.jpg" width="134" height="250" alt="" title="A Coronet" />
<div class="caption"><p>A CORONET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was the harvest-time for the embroiderers, or at least it ought to
have been, but it is not on record that their services were rewarded with
any magnificent generosity. Embroidery was rampant: all state garments
were traced with gold, and vivid colours would adorn robes and mantles
alike, a favourite design being a series of circles.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_b_013a.jpg" width="171" height="100" alt="" title="A Brooch" />
<div class="caption"><p>A BROOCH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The pelisse now came into existence; in form it was a close-fitting
dress, a prototype of the garment which bears the same title to-day. Fur
was a modish trimming, and nine bars of fur are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mentioned as a trimming of some special grey pelisse which King John
bestowed upon Isabella of Angoul√™me. Obviously the sealskin paletot and
the sable cape were not amongst the possibilities of that hour, or His
Majesty would not have been let off so cheaply.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_b_014.jpg" width="350" height="264" alt="" title="A plain wimple" />
<div class="caption"><p>A PLAIN WIMPLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But to the enthusiastic chronicler of fashion there was one fact of
King John's reign which was pre-eminently worthy and admirable. This was
the introduction of the wimple, of all attributes to feminine beauty
surely the most becoming ever conceived or accomplished! It was made
either in silk or linen, a covering for the neck, chin, and forehead at
once disguiseful and provocative, coquettish and demure. At times the
wimple was little more than an elaborated veil or kerchief, but in its
most alluring form it was a separate article worn under the veil, as
in a nun's dress of to-day, which, in fact, in all but colour, bears a
striking resemblance to the thirteenth-century dress. Indeed Chaucer
distinguishes the two when he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Wering a vaile insted of wimple,</div>
  <div class="i0">As nonnes don in ther abbey.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wimple was wrapped round the head and chin, and ladies of wealth
bound it on the forehead by a golden or jewelled fillet, while their
poorer sisters used plain silk. Silken wimples were forbidden to the
nuns, who were then as now devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to white linen. It is not unlikely that the wimple originated with the
fashion of wearing the coverchief about the neck, and it was towards the
end of the twelfth century that the coverchief underwent transformation,
growing smaller and being tied under the chin like a modern cap or
bonnet.</p>

<p>Boots and shoes formed an important portion of dress in the twelfth
century, and here again the interfering cleric played his favourite r√¥le
of denunciator. The monks, who were denied their wear, abused with vigour
the peak-toed boots and shoes, which indeed reached a point exquisitely
ridiculous when a courtier could choose to stuff the points of his shoes
with tow, so that they might curl up like ram's horns. Dispassionately, I
recognise as much wit as wisdom in the notion.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_b_015.jpg" width="200" height="105" alt="" title="A shoe" />
<div class="caption"><p>A SHOE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Women wore short boots as well as shoes, but the dresses were so long
that only the tips of the toes could be seen, and they were content to
embroider these in gold with fanciful or circular devices.</p>

<p>Gloves, jewelled at the back, were chosen by the richer classes, and
coarsely-made warm gloves without fingers received a mild patronage from
the poor. But women wore gloves very rarely; they were not amongst the
trifles which attracted feminine attention, though there was much general
love for variety, and a vast amount of money, care, and thought was
bestowed on personal adornment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/i_b_016.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="" title="Daagged Costume in the Twelfth Century" />
<div class="caption"><p>DAGGED COSTUME IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the early part of the thirteenth century many beautiful fabrics put
in an appearance. Velvet, and silk interwoven with gold, and cloth with many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
colours were fashionable, while it became a very popular practice to
ornament hems of garments by cutting them into indented tabs or leaves, a
fashion to which I have referred previously as "dagged," the contemporary
expression. How pretty the dagged costume may be is easily realised by
glancing at the picture on page 16, which shows it entirely made in
cloth, crowned by a white linen turban with a band of linen under the
chin.</p>

<p>The turban adorned many a fair and dark head, the Spanish women
wearing it exclusively, drawing their inspiration for this, and for their
trailing robes and funnel-shaped sleeves, from the Arab fashions.</p>

<p>Frenchwomen asserted themselves as pioneers with the closely-fitting
garment that allowed the lines of the figure to be seen, a legitimate
ancestress to our princess gown. Sleeves established their right to
exist in more than one form, some being wide at the top, others narrow,
close-fitting, and fastened at the wrists, and others again narrow at the
top and to the middle of the forearm, where they widened and fell almost
to the ground.</p>

<p>The cuirass dress was often slightly open at the neck in order to show
the under-garment, and a long girdle embroidered in gold was passed round
the waist, crossed behind and brought round again to the front a little
lower down, where it was tied so that the ends fell loosely. In the
twelfth century this style of gown was frequently draped on the hips and
worn without the embroidered bodice or the girdle, and a favoured long
robe was open from top to bottom and fastened with buttons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Mantles were semicircular in cut and held in divers ways, and their
borders were adorned with rectangular metal plaques, each pierced with
five holes, a double cord being passed through these holes and fastened
behind.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A CLASPED AND JEWELLED GIRDLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An affection for jewels, rings and collars of pearls, diadems and
clasps, was common to all the nobles of all the nations, while caps,
wimples, and veils crowned the fair with grace, and permitted some
diversity of expression.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century the English historian declares that in
France fashion danced the gayest tunes and was uproarious in her demand
for extravagance, and, if French chroniclers are to be believed,
moderation marked the footsteps of the native mondaine, whose shoes were
comparatively low and bore small points. But I doubt not that, then as
now, each woman was a profit to her own country, and did her duty to
commerce by prodigality with unswerving enthusiasm.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="p5">IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY</p>

<p>A comparative simplicity marked the raiment of the thirteenth
century, when the elaborate detail yielded place to ample folds of
drapery, capacious mantles, and flowing trains. It was a simplicity,
however, which cannot conscientiously be congratulated upon its
economical habits, for the fabrics employed were of the richest and
most sumptuous, and the breadth of the garments was prodigious. The
dress which is so proudly worn by the Queen in the illustration on
page 20, is characteristically splendid, and a glance at it shows that
it was fashioned of a thick brocade traced in diamond design, and cut
square in the neck and very long in the sleeves, where a few folds of
white lawn appear becomingly above the wrists, the veil falling from
neck to hem, and the enfolding gorget being fastened tightly under the
chin. Pre-eminently typical was another dress honoured by this Eleanor
of Provence&mdash;a most unpopular lady, by the way, even though her
taste in costume might have made for some measure of success, at least
amongst her feminine subjects. She chose "a gown of gold brocade,
sleeves reaching to the wrists, while over this she wore a mantle
bordered with gold and bearing a collar of ermine. The mantle was held
up by a brooch of gold set with jewels, the head crowned with a Gothic
design of floriated trefoils above a jewelled band."</p>

</div>

<p>The following description, commendably brief, which I have read of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a dress worn by the wife of Edward I. will bring home the fashion of
the day to the understanding of the least initiated:&mdash;"A long
gown with loose sleeves; held at the breast by a narrow band is a long
mantle, folds of this covering the feet; ornaments none." But then
no doubt the amiable lady suffered from a popular leaning in favour
of conjugal obedience, and it is well known that King Edward himself
strenuously upheld all simple garb, though it must be admitted that
his descendants showed but small respect for his prejudices when they
buried him in "a dalmatic of red silk damask, a crimson satin mantle
fastened on the shoulders by a gilt fibula decorated with precious
stones; a stola of white tissue ornamented with gilt quatrefolds and
knots crossed on the breast, and jewelled gloves upon his august<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
hands. The lower part of his body was wrapped in a piece of cloth of
gold."</p>

<p>Some severity also marked costume in France at this time, when there
was a suggestion of the ecclesiastical in the high <em>guimpe</em> without
which no dress was complete. This was a fancy inaugurated by the second
wife of Philip III. for the special benefit of her long throat and flat
chest; and worn in company with a pointed head-dress and a flowing
veil, a closely-fitting long robe of brocade, and an embroidered
mantle, the general effect must have been entirely dignified and
impressive. Simplicity, however, did not reign here long, and Louis IX.
of France appears to have been quite lenient towards extravagance, and
to have had a nice taste of his own, judging from the picture which
represents him wearing a velvet cap, a tunic open at the neck, and a
robe of brown embroidered with red flowers, and possessing long sleeves
trimmed with fur. Fur was amongst his weaknesses evidently, for a
deep cape of fur covers his shoulders in another picture, where he is
wearing a fur-trimmed robe and has indulged himself with red stockings
and black shoes. This was the King who urged his courtiers to dress
themselves well and neatly, so that their wives would love them the
more, and their people esteem them higher.</p>

<p>Philip the Fair, or Unfair, of France decreed that "No damoiselle,
if she be not <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ch√¢telaine</i> or dame owning 2000 levies yearly, shall
have more than one pair of gowns per year; and if she be, she shall
have two pairs and no more"&mdash;an edict which was, of course, defied
fearlessly. Sumptuary laws come somehow to be disregarded, proving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
courage of women in defence of their idol&mdash;fashion.</p>

<p>Very curious is a coiffure which obtained in the reign of Philip the
Bold, consisting of a covering like a plate in outline worn upon the
head, with a veil falling over the cheeks and pendent at the back. Far
more attractive must have been the head-dress of peacock's feathers
which obtained about that time, when prodigality began to assert itself
defiantly in magnificent jewels and gowns of condal emblazoned with
rubies and sapphires; and when silken hose, gold and silver embroidery,
and furred trimmings were amongst the attainable and the attained.</p>

<p>Lavishness ruled in Italy in the thirteenth century, when women wore
long full gowns of silk velvet brocade, and tissues of gold and silver,
and woollen materials dyed violet or scarlet. They had very large
sleeves, their hands often being more than half covered with these,
which touched the ground; and ornaments of pearls and borders of gold
edged with pearls were chapters in the story of magnificence, little
hoods adorned with gold and pearls and embroidery speaking the final
word of splendour. The Italian matron wore a long mantle touching the
ground, and open in the front, fastened with buttons or clasps enriched
with pearls, and lined with silk and decked with gold, and when the
hood was dispensed with, the hair was covered with a light transparent
veil of silk.</p>

<p>The kirtle worn in England in the reign of Edward I. was in form
plain to the point of severity, but over it on occasions there flowed a
robe with a long train, the ladies of rank choosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the kirtle in as rich material as the robe, which they removed as a
mark of respect when attending on illustrious guests.</p>

<p>The kirtle was a garment originally common to both sexes, and is
best described as a smock frock, although the term at different times
has been permitted to signify a cloak, a gown, a waistcoat, and even a
petticoat, and in the fifteenth century it was disgraced into a habit
of penance. Most frequently the kirtle was laced closely to the body
and hung straight downwards to the hem.</p>

<p>In the latter years of this century was introduced the <em>surkuane</em>,
which, according to a famous writer, was of Languedocian origin. He
describes it as being a bodice cut down the front and displaying in
the intervals left by the lacings, very wide apart, a transparent
tissue of the chemise elaborately pleated and embroidered in gold
and silver. The existence of this has, however, been disputed by no
less an authority than Planch√©, who has failed to discover any trace
of a thirteenth-century dress fulfilling such conditions. Yet it was
at this time that an edict was passed prohibiting the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cottes lac√©s</i>
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chemises brod√©es</i>, and had there been no such fashion of bodice,
there would have been no temptation for such luxuries, and no occasion
for legislation to check the indulgence. The embroidered shift was
forbidden to all save brides, who were permitted it on their wedding
day and for the twelve succeeding months. Surely to have set such
limit on the wear of dainty <em>lingerie</em> encouraged that reprehensible
being the slatternly wife, whose charms do not outlive her trousseau.
The costume of the bridegroom is not specialised, but man under less
ecstatic circumstances seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
have been distinguished by a large cloak with full sleeves and a hood,
a white linen coif tied under his chin, while a fantastic sort of close
cap formed headgear common alike to France, Germany, and England, the
origin being doubtful. Beneath the long cloak men wore a long gown
reaching to the feet, and fastened at the waist, and as an alternative
to this they could choose a tunic to the knee, with wide sleeves to the
elbow, the fitting sleeves of the under-tunic terminating at the wrists
and fastening with a closely-set row of buttons, or, if the buttons
were omitted, sewn tightly round.</p>

<p>Briefly, women's dress in England in the thirteenth century
consisted of a wimple and gorget swathed round the neck and fastened by
pins above the ears, concealing alike brow and chin; the full gown worn
loose had sleeves trailing on the ground, and the under-garment, which
was generally darker than the gown, had tight-fitting sleeves turned up
from the wrists. The poorer women wore a somewhat shorter gown caught
up under the arm to reveal the under-garment, and high boots reaching
to the calf of the leg and fastened with a double row of buttons. In
France, however, the women of the middle and lower classes wore grey
shoes, whence it is supposed the word "grisette" was born, which from
modern usage has come to typify "somebody captivating who dwells in the
Latin quarter."</p>

<p>There were, however, changes which deserve mention. The hood was
still in favour, and the long wide circular cloak was worn fastened
at the neck with double cords, and the trains of the dresses became
abnormally extended, evoking from idle critics many more or less witty
quips which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
may or may not have influenced the subsequent lessening of the trains.
Gradually the width of the dresses decreased as their length increased,
and the girdle had the privilege of existing merely as an ornament,
while the cuffs of the under-sleeves were adorned with buttons, and
the hanging over-sleeve was cut as a long bag from the elbow to the
shoulders, where it fastened into the robe and fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Amongst the wise saws of ancient instance was the advice in the
<cite>Romance of the Rose</cite>, "that ladies should let trailing robes hide the
feet of those too large and unsightly, but that the more beautifully
gifted could hold up their skirts and proceed in comfort." Herein may
we realise that wisdom is no new counsellor in the ways of vanity,
and I am quite convinced that some such philosopher must have guided
the selection of the dame whose picture faces page 22 in draperies of
pink over mauve, with a purple mantle lined with red. Nothing could be
more becoming than the simple lines of her gown which flow from neck
to hem, trimmed at the top with gold jewels set with emeralds, while
round her brow is a golden fillet, with a fold of white lawn under the
chin holding this from side to side. How attractive are these lawn
folds may be noted again on a famous canvas, which portrays a dress
of the same period in thick brocade, with a plain over-skirt bordered
with embroidery, and the broad flat turban hat flanked on either side
by wings elaborately decked with jewels, with a pendent veil from the
back.</p>

<p>There is much virtue in the veil, and its length and condition were
varied to suit the individual and her circumstance. On state occasions
it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
be overspread by another veil, and above it by the women of quality
would be placed a crown of gold; or it would assert its influence over
the hair, which was parted on the forehead, curled or plaited behind
the ears, and confined in a gold net known as a crispine; women of
highest degree choosing this crispine of gold thread set with jewels
and encircling it by a gold band also jewelled, which would form the
frame for the veil. This crispine in various forms was the common
fashion for a long time, and when discarded the hair was bound tightly
to the head with a silken fillet and garlands of flowers.</p>

<p>Alike in the decoration of the head and in the fabrics which were
chosen to glorify the simple gowns, it appears to have been quite
possible to evade the spirit, while obeying the letter, of the law of
simplicity which the rulers demanded at the hands of fashion. Fashion
granted it with a difference, and while rigidly austere in cut, clothes
were so generally magnificent in their material and so generous in
their width, that ruin might wait swiftly upon the prodigal with a
pretty fancy in frocks. And to think that the security of a Married
Women's Property Act was outside the ken and comfort of the weak and
confiding lord, who loved his lady too well to deny her caprice!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="p5">IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY</p>


<p>Sumptuous and ever more sumptuous grew dress in the fourteenth
century, when the outfit brought by Isabella of France, upon the
occasion of her marriage with Edward II., was a conspicuous example of
the possibilities of extravagance. Historians have it that her robes
were of gold and silver and of shot taffeta and velvet, that there
were many beautiful furs, and that six dozen coifs and 419 yards of
linen, and six dresses of green cloth, six dresses splendidly marbled,
and six dresses of rose scarlet were included in her possessions.
Sovereigns in those times took unto themselves some pride in leading
the fashions, and we have Anne, wife of Richard II., effecting the
introduction of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">c√¥te hardie</i>, a garment not unlike a waistcoat,
fitting closely on the hips and trimmed round with a border of fur and
buttoned down the front. This was cut square below the neck and boasted
long tight-fitting sleeves, and was made of either plain or embroidered
material, or it displayed, as did so many of the garments of that day,
an embroidered border. Embroidery flourished in the reign of Richard
II., when dress, petticoat, and mantle would be emblazoned with the
arms of the wearer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
family, and the device of a bird and tree adorned with stately grace
many a mantle of Richard's Queen, who must be credited with a most
admirable inclination towards beautiful frocks. In the picture given
she is shown wearing a train of peacock-blue velvet bordered with gold
and embroidered with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lys</i>, while her head appears to
great advantage with a short veil beneath her crown, her hair being
braided over the ears and a small lawn band supporting her chin. The
sleeve of this frock shows the fancy which obtained for the long scarf
held above the elbow and falling with long ends edged with fur; and
the little chemisette and the white cuffs give a winning suggestion of
simplicity to an attire completely magnificent.</p>

</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_028fpa.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>Her royal consort decked himself with dress no less elaborate, fur,
gold, embroidery, and brocade and velvet all having the privilege
of adorning His Majesty, whose courtiers wore robes emblazoned and
embroidered with precious stones, and mantles sliced in pointed leaf
or square indented edges. Parti-coloured garments were their delight,
the dress often being divided in two, half in one colour and half in
another, hose suffering like treatment; and their wide sleeves, known
as "devil's receptacles," trailed along the ground, with many slashings
to decorate them. The Troubadours gaily twanged the guitar and other
instruments at the tournament, where the dames and matrons rode in
parti-coloured tunics, with hoods and long tails to them, and bore
small gold or silver swords or daggers in the girdle, which fell over
the hips instead of encircling the waist.</p>

<p>Ermine shed its soft influence on many of the
stiffest of silks, and dresses were completely lined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with ermine, which also bordered the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">c√¥te hardie</i>. A deep royal blue
was a very favourite colour, and jewels obtained in abundance, girdles
being encrusted with these, while no neck seemed complete without a
necklace of four rows of jewels and a pendent cross.</p>

<p>A good example of the dress worn by the middle class may be taken
from Chaucer's Wife of Bath. He tells us she wore on her head on
Sundays a fine cloth kerchief which weighed a pound, and scarlet
stockings and fine new shoes; she travelled in a wimple and a very
broad hat and cloak. The Miller's wife went abroad in a girdle, barred
all of silk, and a white apron or barme cloth, as it was then called.
Her shift had its collar embroidered in front and behind with black
silk, and she covered her head with a white cap tied with strings,
above a broad silk fillet. She had a leathern purse with metal buttons
and silken tassels depending from her girdle.</p>

<p>Edward II.'s reign welcomed a new mode of dressing the hair, which
was parted in the middle; over each ear was a golden basket, and on the
top was a band of gold, narrower in the centre and broader towards the
ears, and the coverchief was placed on the top of the head. A peculiar
method too was the arranging of the hair in sausage rolls, covered with
a white veil held in a lattice-work of gold. On the whole, head-dresses
were more remarkable than beautiful and becoming. The caput, which came
a little later, and might have been called ugly, fitted closely to the
head, and had a broad scolloped border, and sometimes, in addition, two
lappets which hung to the waist; others were pointed as the bishop's
mitre; and most were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
characterised by a lack of height with no hair visible; and the pendent
veil at the back bore an embroidered border. There was much hankering
after yellow hair in the reign of Richard II., and those who were
unblessed with golden locks would dye them with saffron.</p>

<p>Gloves received the special attention of women in the fourteenth
century, and, when not actually on the hands, were placed in the girdle
or carried. The gauntlets were jewelled, and embroidery was on the back
or round the base of the fingers. Spain and France were famous for
their proficiency and industry in the making of gloves, and fur and
sheepskin were used for these as well as wool and silk.</p>

<p>In Germany the costume affected during the fourteenth century
differed but little from that of the thirteenth. The dress of the
women consisted of a long garment with a shorter under-dress, and over
this another dress was worn, and over this again a mantle. The loose
under-garment was very long, closely fitting to the hips, whence the
skirt increased considerably in width; long narrow sleeves were made of
white or coloured silk or of fine linen, and the necks of the dresses
and the borders of the sleeves were trimmed with tracings of gold; a
short chemise was visible from neck to waist, and the Hausfrau bunch of
keys hung from the girdle. It is on record, indeed, that German women
in this century were buried with their keys, and that divorced women
were bound to return them to their husbands. Young girls wore a long
sleeveless robe closely fitting to the hips and ample in the skirt, and
over this a long gown of equal fulness fell from the neck, extremely
wide upon the shoulders, and covering the forearm on both sides as a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
tabard, circular pieces being cut out from each side, and the lower
portion of the skirt sewn up. The old Teuton mode of hair-dressing with
flowing locks prevailed, but plaiting also was in vogue, twisted with
coloured or gold ribbons, or held at the back in a golden net. Simple
garlands of flowers were placed in the hair, and a fillet of stuff or
metal, this being shaped either as a crown, a diadem, or a coronet; and
the matron adopted a fur-trimmed cap.</p>

<p>Italy in the fourteenth century showed a decided tendency to return
to the classic form of dress. Long robes fashioned like the old tunic
and stola fell in graceful folds round the figure to the ground; the
sleeves were of moderate width, permitting the under-sleeves to be seen
fitting tightly to the wrists. The dawn of the Renaissance brought some
changes in costume, notably in the over-dress, then called a "simarre,"
which fitted closely in the bodice and outspread in a full trained
skirt. This simarre was sometimes made open from neck to hem, and held
together at the top by a square brooch; and the sleeves were of two
varieties, either quite tight or else wider and very long, ending in
a point, but invariably bearing some decorative border. The girdle
definitely slipped to the hips, and the description of a Florentine
dress runs: "A simarre of brocade fastened with small buttons on
either side, the back hanging quite straight, the girdle being worn
in front of the dress only." Very pretty must have been the cypriane,
a gown of French origin which was worn with a high belt and had a
triangular-shaped opening low on the bodice, a veil covering the bosom,
and a delicate ruffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
encircling the neck; the puffed sleeves and the back of the dress
were slashed. A semicircular cloak was thrown over the shoulders and
fastened in front, and left open or buttoned from throat to hem. The
married women chose a sleeveless over-dress, and a long red or blue
cloak, capacious and enveloping, and the widow wore this in black,
surmounted by a long white veil. Caps, veils, and fillets found equal
favour in the eyes of the Italian, whose pretty hair was as frequently
seen bound with satin ribbons as with gold or silver paillettes, or
arranged spirally, or confined in a caul; and the horseshoe shape of
head-dress common in England was also to be seen in Italy, who borrowed
it from France, where the skirts were now gradually becoming narrower
and the dresses buttoning straight down the front, the skirt and bodice
being cut in one, and the sleeves invested with much diversity, being
worn tight or loose, buttoned or hanging open, displaying in some cases
the forearm and in others a close under-sleeve.</p>

</div>

<p>The sleeveless surcoat was very popular, the upper portion tapering
to a small point upon the shoulders, showing the gown worn beneath, and
the skirts of these surcoats were decked with ermine and emblazoned
with the family arms. The art of embroidery was cultivated assiduously
by the rich, whose leisured moments were spent in plying the needle
and silk, to accomplish devices which should honour and grace their
attire.</p>

<p>Veils of white linen enwrapped the head, and unbound hair was rarely
seen except on young girls. A richly embroidered cap that received some
attention was so shaped that it partly covered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
cheeks, and below it were two ear-cages of metallic tissue in plaited
design. A very curious head-dress in France was composed of a
closely-fitting cap with a jewelled border, surmounted by a long flat
piece of material placed over the forehead and hanging down behind,
this being elaborately trimmed and jewelled, and completely hiding the
hair.</p>

<p>It is written to the honour of Isabella of Bavaria that she
encouraged the ladies of her Court in a great love for dress, and
she would seem to have made a study of the subject, if one judges
from a picture of her robed in regal array, with a horned head-dress
surmounted by a crown, an elaborate robe profusely adorned with jewels,
a mantle bordered with ermine, and a train of prodigal extent.</p>

<p>The surcoat received the honour of sleeves in the latter part of the
century, and these hung almost to the hem of the skirt, while the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">c√¥te hardie</i>
took unto itself another shape, the shoulders being broader,
the bodice cut low, and edged with fur, with folds of white silk to
form a collar, a short waist being simulated by the wearing of the
girdle high. The last twenty years of the century saw the introduction
of high coverchiefs, mostly crescent-shaped or horned, one of the
former being contrived of two heart-shaped pieces of silk with rolled
edges, the spaces between the two sides being occupied with a veil of
cloth.</p>

</div>

<p>Henry IV., with tender solicitude for his own comfort and beauty,
invented a cloth head-dress which enwrapped his bald pate and bore a
gold device on one side, and a fringe on the hem. A novel head-dress
for a woman, calculated to show both itself and the hair at the best,
shows plaits worn outside the lawn covering, as in the picture. This
must have been most attractive; so too would be a lawn head-dress which
set outwards and upon a frame at the back, whence it hung straight
across to form a most becoming background. The origin of this was
German, and its accomplishment was a little complicated, involving
the arrangement of the ordinary band of linen round the face, while
above was drapery of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">appliqu√©</i> work in white or white of silver. The
short veil which came above this again was kept in place by a jewelled
circlet, the cloth around the throat and shoulders being cut in one
with the inner band of the wimple.</p>

HAIR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Amongst the most attractive descriptions that I have found of dress
in this period is one of a Frenchwoman whose hair was entwined with
black ribbon, and whose dress was of white embroidered in silver, with
small sleeves of red and white check bordered with gold.</p>

<p>Cambric of a sort&mdash;not as we know it to-day&mdash;must have
been indispensable, for it enwrapped the head, and formed the <em>guimpe</em>,
and had the privilege of making small ruffles. A dress of decided
charm was made of brocade, cut in one piece to the knees, and thence
flounced with ermine to the ground. The bodice was low to the waist,
and from the waist to the bust was filled in with white cambric, and an
ermine collar was round the shoulders. The sleeves were very tight to
the wrists, with ermine cuffs extending over the hands, and from the
pointed head-dress fell a long veil with embroidered border.</p>

<p>Women had plenty of chance to indulge their desire for variety in
the minor accessories of dress, in their embroidered purses, their
jewelled girdles, their decorated borders, their <em>guimpes</em> and their
ornamented gloves. All of these gave opportunity for the display of
the individual taste, and it must be regarded somewhat regretfully
that there were no fashion papers in that day, or we who come after
would not have been left so high and dry for detail. Still, we may be
grateful for the written record that aprons were first seen in this
period, and that they were tied with ribbons; that widows were denied
the privilege of elaborate costume; and that white gowns were devoted
to home wear. And so much may we accept with content, remembering the
entirely novel <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">c√¥te hardie</i> with gratitude as one novelty in the
century. Perhaps it would be greedy to demand more.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="p5">IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</p>


<p>Extravagance to the fantastic point pursued its outrageous way in
the fifteenth century; the dresses were tightly belted at the waist,
and trailed long lengths upon the floor, while the flat collars of
velvet or fur pointed towards the front and were cut to display a
square stomacher, and the sleeves indulged themselves with many
diversions, small ruffles appearing to finish those which were tight at
the wrists. The celebrated, never-to-be-forgotten horned head-dresses
stuffed with tow made their appearance in England in the reign of Henry
V., the reign of Henry VI. having the privilege of welcoming these in
heart-shape; and large turbans in Turkish form found favour with the
women during the greater part of the reign of Edward IV.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>AN ELABORATE HEAD-DRESS IN THE REIGN OF HENRY V.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The fashion of bordering dresses and skirts with deep flounces of
fur and velvet was introduced rather late in the century, and silken
girdles of conspicuous width were held up by jewelled clasps, and
innumerable gold chains fell round the neck. The round cap, covered by
a kerchief hanging to the ground, was popular, and the steeple form of
head-dress with pendent drapery tucked under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the arm was a distinctive feature of the time. Head-dress in the
reign of Henry V. was perhaps as exquisitely ridiculous as it was
ridiculously exquisite, but, whatever its faults, it possessed the
supreme virtue of being becoming. What face would not look well under
the influence of such a head-dress as that sketched on this page?
Picture it made soft and white beneath a turban of colour, and with
jewels flanking it on either side beneath. The horned head-dress looked
its best&mdash;and that it had a best is no questionable point&mdash;in
jewelled velvet, when beneath it fell a long veil in graceful folds.
The picture on page 42 shows a head-dress accurately planned upon a
perfectly fitting frame, with white at the top and back, and jewelled
velvet as an outline for the ear-pieces, while the band of white
across the front is lawn, again traced with a colour. The sugar-loaf
head-dress was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
usually ornamented with a band of black velvet embroidered in gold.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>ELIZABETH OF WOODVILLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is a fine record of Elizabeth of Woodville in the British
Museum, her hair pale yellow in colour, arranged with a small curl on
the forehead, and brought up under a high crown, with large closed
arches whence it falls, the points of the arches being finished with
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs-de-lys</i>. Her dress is of gold brocaded
in blue, and the sleeves are tight-fitting; ermine outlines the
shoulders, and a crimson scarf does its picturesque duty as a girdle,
and a broad hem of ermine outlines the skirt, which is very full and
has an extremely long train; and beneath the dress we are allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a peep of a blue petticoat and pointed shoes. Several of the ladies
attendant upon all this elegance have the privilege of appearing with
her in the illumination, in high caps with the hair drawn through
the top, short-waisted gowns, and trains with fur borders. Another
gown which had the advantage of serving royalty was close-fitting and
short-waisted, with tight sleeves, embroidered cuffs, and a collar
which took almost the form of a small cape, held in front with a square
brooch jewelled in the centre, and bearing three pendants. A row of
pearls defined the edge of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d√©colletage</i>, a necklace of gold
encircled the throat, and the flat, close-fitting cap was embroidered
in gold.</p>

<p>Elizabeth of Woodville is represented on the previous page in a
close, slightly-pointed coif made of a trellis of ribbon and jewelled
above the cap of black, the filmy white veil hanging over these with
much grace; and the bodice of her velvet dress, which is cut round to
show a fine linen chemisette, bears collar and cuffs of embroidery.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>VARIETIES OF THE HENNIN.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_040fpa.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>The hennin reached its height of popularity in every sense of the
word in the reign of Edward V. Briefly it may be described as a lawn
kerchief stiffened with canes or wires, these kerchiefs being plain
or diapered with gold, the frame projecting outward from the back of
the head, and beneath it the hair is gathered up into a caul of gold
or embroidery. The original hennin was a tall funnel-shaped tube in
brocade worked in beads and fixed firmly on the head, and from the top
floated a fine veil. The "little hennin" was a short head-dress covered
by a veil which fell over the shoulders. The hennins&mdash;and you can
see many examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
decorating the coloured page&mdash;were large or small, plain or
decorated, as the individual fancy might dictate, and their adoption
was common alike to England and to France, where they afforded a
complete change from their predecessors, the small <em>b√©guins</em> or hoods,
and shared favour with the two-horned head-dresses, with horns about a
yard high. The linen for the hennin was stiff, to help the fine wire or
cane frames to do their duty with greater success; and to accentuate
further their importance there were great wings on either side, so
widely set that the passing of a doorway was a difficulty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_041.jpg" width="468" height="422" alt="" title="The Horned Head dress" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE HORNED HEAD-DRESS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Priests and husbands inveighed alike against this fashion, and
one monk felt its absurdities so acutely that he rode through the
provinces, deploring the excess of the hennin as of equal gravity with
that of gambling and the throwing of dice. He preached this doctrine so
plausibly that he induced the easily-aroused populace to chase in the
streets the women who were wearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hennin, and even to spatter them with mud or pelt them with stones.
Such enthusiasm, however, like the photographs of Hiawatha, "failed
completely"; and after the departure of the prophet, hennins grew and
ever grew, and they were decked with jewels and hung with chains, and
all the best obtainable prodigalities of fashion were consecrated to
their honour.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>HEAD-DRESS Of JEWELLED VELVET AND LAWN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Attention was given, not only to the horned head-dress, which
developed into two high points curled inward with pendent veils from
the tops, but also to the turban, made after the fashion of those worn
in the East. It had thick rolls of silk or velvet round the head,
the hair being pulled up the centre and worn hanging down the back,
a drapery assisting in the Oriental effect. The escoffion&mdash;for
which, although it is said to have been introduced by England, there is
no English word&mdash;is crescent-shaped like a turban; and a cap which
received some patronage was heart-shaped, made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
embroidered material decked with a trellis-work of braid ornamented
with beads, the wide band in front being set with precious stones,
which again took the form of a heart as they rested upon the forehead.
The women of the middle classes wore cloth caps and bands of material
twisted round the head, with wings on either side.</p>

<p>Early in the fifteenth century the scolloped sleeves were
introduced, and the dresses were cut in one in front, and separated at
the back with a sort of basque.</p>

<p>To France we owe the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">houppelande</i>, worn alike by men and women, and
seemingly obsessed by the virtue of comfort. It bears close kinship to
the dressing-gown of to-day, and had at its best a battlemented border
outlined by some contrasting stuff or trimming. It developed various
extravagances of decorations and breadth, but you may see it well shown
in its earliest form in the picture on this page.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_043.jpg" width="320" height="600" alt="" title="The Houppelande" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE HOUPPELANDE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the end of the fifteenth century the dresses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
well supplied with large full sleeves, were invariably cut square at
the neck, and bore stomachers jewelled or embroidered, and beneath
these were buckles, or belts or rich girdles with long pendants, like
the one illustrated, which is worn round the hips and fastened in front
with three clasps and tassels. Side by side with this appears the
pointed shoe of the period; made in red patterned with white, it has
charms which are obtrusive if not convincing, though they served to
inspire some preacher in France, more violent than holy, to denounce
them as "an outrage against the Creator."</p>

<p>The famous Agnes Sorel had considerable influence over the fashions
of her day, and she practised exaggeration with audacity: her hennin
was taller than any other, her skirts were longer, and her bodices
lower; and she would band her forehead and encircle her throat with the
most magnificent jewels.</p>

<p>Elizabeth of York had a fancy for veils richly jewelled at the
border and arranged to form a hood and fall down either side of the
face, the hair being plainly parted on her forehead. The picture on
the opposite page shows her wearing a full gown of silk brocade, with
a border of ermine decorating the hem of this and the sleeves, and
putting in its appearance again straight across the bodice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
down the centre of the front. On her head hangs a stiff mitred
head-dress, the inner rim being outlined with jewels, and her pendent
veil reaches nearly to the waist.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_045.jpg" width="427" height="600" alt="" title="Elizabeth of York" />
<div class="caption"><p>ELIZABETH OF YORK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Not being content with the weight of brocades and silks they had to
carry, the women burdened themselves with canes with handles bearing
the image of a bird. They carried fans, too, and collected from Spain
perfumed gloves made of kid or silk, with the backs embroidered in gold
or silver; the glove, however, was punctiliously removed when the hand
was given in greeting.</p>

<p>France exhibited a nice sense of colour, and the most popular
combination was a veil of white tissue, a girdle of green wrought with
gold, and a glimpse of violet under-skirt below a brocaded dress "set
off with black shoes."</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">c√¥te hardie</i> was improved by being cut open in a point in
front, with revers upon the shoulders, and a lappet of velvet or
brocade was used to fill in the opening, and, turning back, revealed
some delicate tissue of gauze and lace.</p>

<p>The noble ladies of Germany affected much simplicity, adopting this
attitude in contrast to that of the burghers' wives and daughters.
Their costume was narrow in cut, the close-fitting skirt widening as it
reached the ground. The bodices were cut low off the shoulders, laced
in front, with tightly-fitting sleeves that buttoned the whole length,
and were finished by cuffs extending over the hands. The over-dress had
wide sleeves and a long train laced below the waist behind, the fulness
held at the bust with a girdle. Mantles were of a semicircular shape,
with a long train fastening to the front with a buckle, or finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with a turnover collar held in place with ribbons on the shoulders. The
shorter mantle known as the "tappert" was open at each side, and had a
large upstanding collar and hood, and married women affected a circular
cloak gathered at the neck by a cord and falling in voluminous folds to
the hem.</p>

<p>Young girls and matrons braided their hair, or parted it simply in
the centre, and rolled it in two portions bound with ribbon or twisted
fillets; these rolls, brought over the ears to form a frame for the
face, were held in a gold net, with a jewelled pendant in the centre.
A favourite cap had a thickly ruched border, and another, known as the
Burgundian, had a high conical crown with a rounded point, and was worn
over a kerchief with the veil floating behind. Gold bands and crowns
rested on the hair, a rectangular kerchief folded in two receiving
some attention. Shoes were made open with points, and wooden clogs and
goloshes expressed the Teuton caution.</p>

<p>As the century drew to its close further license was visible. High
dress was the exception, all bodices being round with slight points,
the shoulders uncovered, and the back cut down as low as the waist; and
sleeves exhibited much diversity of design, being at times narrow and
at others full, and then again falling far below the hands, or reaching
up to the elbow, ornamented with slashings. Over-dresses were laced at
the back, and invariably the openings were filled in with the chemise,
or a folded fichu, or an embroidered plastron. Men and women alike wore
wonderful chemisettes with wide borders embroidered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
silk, or wrought with pearls, and fur was a decoration beloved of both
sexes.</p>

<p>Fur adorns the short over-sleeve of the coat sketched on page 52;
and the wearer, it would seem, had infinitely better fortune in the
selection of his vest and soft shirt than in his mushroom hat, which,
made of cloth and stitched, could not have failed to be at least trying
to the most perfect beauty.</p>

<p>Trains extended themselves when the waists of the bodices grew
shorter, and the dresses were gathered in front, pleats falling from
the bust or just below the short waist. The girdles appeared just below
the armpits, and the sleeves were so long that they had to be turned
back from the wrists, the scolloped border appearing on those which
were wide and wing-shaped.</p>

<p>In France and England splendour followed upon splendour; even the
prayer-books did not escape the general craze for elaboration and
decoration, their covers being emblazoned with jewels and silken
embroidery. Jewels glittered round every fair neck and on every fair
head; and all heads were fair, assisted by art when nature denied such
grace.</p>

<p>The hair and the train were the conspicuous points of magnificence,
and fashion, playing the game of heads and tails, allowed them both to
win her best attention.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="p5">IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</p>


<p>The Tudor period brought an extraordinary revolution in dress, the
first important change taking place in the sleeves, which were now
of different material and different colour from the gown. Several
pairs of sleeves would be allotted to each gown, and were necessarily
made detachable, while in shape they were full and puffed, padded
and quilted and slashed and fitting tightly; and the square-necked,
short-waisted style of dress was punctilious in a display of a
stomacher and a full train.</p>

<p>Cloth of gold was the favourite fabric, being used alike for
decoration as for garments, and indeed gold asserted itself on every
rich material, and there was a silver taffeta embroidered in gold;
and a damask of crimson or yellow wrought with gold offered itself
persuasively for fur trimming, lynx and sable and marten accepting the
responsibility with zeal.</p>

<p>The fair footed it bravely in low shoes adorned with large ribbon
Tudor roses, which were also allotted the delicate duty of ornamenting
elaborate garters. The plainer variety of shoe was of wood covered with
velvet or leather, stitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with silk and fastened with buckles or rosettes; and a wooden shoe in
vogue was known as the pantoffle, and not unlike that chopine worn
in Italy at this time and later, when it attained the pinnacle of
the preposterous. This shoe was, however, known in England only in a
modified form.</p>

<p>None of the fashions of the day could truthfully be called
comfortable. Comfort obviously was banished from consideration, and
each innovation during the sixteenth century shows its demands more and
more disregarded.</p>

<p>The hoop appeared, and held the best affections in its grasp of
iron, wood, or whalebone, the indispensable edicts against it following
quickly upon its popularity. Rich and poor alike fell victims to its
aggressive charms, and alike insisted upon its wear, and, on the
occasion of her marriage with Prince Arthur of Wales, Catherine of
Medici wore the dress of Spain and a mantilla bordered with gold and
precious stones, and her skirt was distended by several hoops.</p>

<p>The wives of that merry polygamist Henry VIII. were sympathetically
attached to beautiful clothes, and Anne Boleyn is credited with wearing
a cap of blue velvet trimmed with golden bells, and a vest of velvet
starred with silver, and over it a surcoat of watered silk lined with
miniver, with large pendent sleeves; blue velvet brodequins were on her
feet, with a diamond star on each instep, and above her long curls was
placed an aureole of plaited gold. It is a well-known fact that Anne,
because of some slight deformity of the hand, held affectionately to
the charms of the hanging sleeve after it had been discarded in favour
of the full puffed and slashed sleeve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
There is an attractive picture of her by Holbein, with the hair drawn
from her forehead in small curls, and a plait hanging from the top of
the head over one ear, the crown being worn rather far back and kept in
place by a jewelled caul.</p>

<p>To Spain historians have granted the laurel of the ruff, which
became first popular in England in the reign of Henry VIII.; and Anne
Boleyn introduced lappets made of velvet and adorned with precious
stones, either pointed at the hem or square and broad.</p>

<p>During those days the length of the gown denoted the rank of the
wearer, countesses and baronesses and ladies of lower degree stamping
their estate upon the dimensions of their train. Embroidery decorated
the gowns and petticoats alike, many of the dresses being cut open in
front to display a satin kirtle and an apron embroidered in gold and
many colours. The bodice of the dress sometimes differed in colour from
the skirt, and the sleeves would match the skirt; and there was much
variety in head-dress, the velvet cap tasselled and set with jewels
above a floating veil being a popular style. But cauls, coifs, and
French hoods, and the high bands in front, were in evidence, together
with a white three-cornered cap, the original no doubt of the Marie
Stuart cap of succeeding years.</p>

<p>The men were as prodigal as the women, and spared no expense or time
or thought in their pursuit of the sumptuous and the elegant; their
shoes and garters and hats glittered with gems, and they wore rings and
chains in profusion, raising the trades of tailors and goldsmiths and
cloth-makers to supreme importance. Jack of Newbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a famous cloth merchant of the time of Henry VIII., is described as
appearing before that monarch in a plain russet coat and a pair of
white kersey slops, the stockings of the same piece being sewn to
his slops. Slops was a term developed from "slip," and signified any
garment easily adjusted, and an example of its use occurs in <cite>Much Ado
About Nothing</cite>, a phrase running "as, a German from the waist downward,
all slops"; hence may the suspicious glean that the Teuton habit of
costume was not mainly trim.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>IN THE TIME OF HENRY VII.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Men yielded to the general craze for an expanded hip, wearing great
breeches stuffed with hair or bran or wool, and exhibiting no less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
feminine enthusiasm in the width of their ruffles. Their hose, of
different detail, was either of cloth or silk, and blazed with colour,
being ornamented with gold or threads of Venetian silver, though
the King himself preferred cloth hose, which also had the honour of
decorating Queen Elizabeth, until she chanced to meet with the silk
stocking, to which she thereafter clung with tenacity.</p>

<p>Jane Seymour's coronation dress was of her faithless spouse's
favourite material, cloth of gold; all his wives seem to have been
obliging enough to yield to his fancy for this extravagance, and this
poor lady's choice was decorated with a raised design of embroidery
and pearls, and the stomacher beneath was thickly encrusted with
jewels, while her surcoat was of purple velvet bordered with ermine
and embroidered with gold, and a jewelled velvet caul was on her head.
Anne of Cleves endeavoured to popularise the Dutch fashion of a gown
without a train, and she was as much a failure in this as in her other
ambitions. Catharine Parr, the last of the noble six, had a gown of
cloth of gold made with a sleeve quite tight at the shoulder, bordered
at the elbow with fur, and showing beneath a slashed and puffed
under-sleeve, finished by a small ruffle at the wrist.</p>

<p>Mary inherited her father's love of splendour and costly apparel,
and her favourite head-dress was of cloth of gold, and her gowns were
generally of velvet trimmed with fur and jewelled. Elizabeth devoted
herself to fashion in a frank, whole-hearted way that brooked no
half-measures, and amongst her terrors of death must have been parting
with her gowns, for she died possessed of no fewer than three thousand
dresses. What a harvest for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ladies-in-waiting or the dealers of the day to gather! Her crimson
locks she piled high up in curls and puffs, surmounted by crowns of
jewels, and her sleeves and hooped skirts were padded into diamond
design traced with embroidery, and every point would hold a pendent
jewel. She showed no desire to achieve grace or elegance below the
waist; nothing more entirely unbecoming to the feminine figure can
be imagined than the tight, hard, flat, narrow bodice terminating in
a point at the front, cut off at the waist on the hips, above the
monstrously distended petticoat. The over-part of the dress and the
skirt beneath it were boned and wired, and tight lacing ruled in an
injurious degree, though the enormous sleeves, ruffles, and skirts
might well have accorded such an effect of slimness as to render
stringent measures unnecessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_055.jpg" width="363" height="600" alt="" title="A Trio of Ruffs" />
<div class="caption"><p>A TRIO OF RUFFS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Dress was a magnificent affair altogether; velvet and taffeta and
fine scarlet cloth were used, lace played its part bravely, and silken
scarves fringed with gold and silver were thrown over the shoulders,
with deep capes of satin or velvet edged with lace. Every shape and
length of garment obtained, and the only extravagance from which dress
did not suffer was in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d√©colletage</i>, which was narrow and straight
and of dimensions eminently decent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_056.jpg" width="500" height="593" alt="" title="Queen Elizabeth in Full Dress" />
<div class="caption"><p>QUEEN ELIZABETH IN FULL DRESS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Elizabeth introduced the whalebone corset, and hers might well
have been called the "wire and whalebone age," for the influence of
these was needed for the petticoats, the gowns and stays, and it had a
considerable share in the good conduct of the ruffles which extended
some nine inches from the neck. In France the ruffles were so enormous
that they hardly allowed their wearers to turn their heads at all, and
courtiers who affected them were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
provided with long-handled spoons to enable them to take their soup in
comfort. These huge ruffs were trimmed with lace outlined with wire
threads to ensure sufficient stiffness, a demand creating the supply of
starch, which made its appearance in this century, being introduced by
the wife of Elizabeth's coachman, who established herself as Lady High
Laundress of the Court, and made at once a competence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and a reputation. Ruffs were of yellow as well as white, and yellow too
were some of the extensive lace collars jewelled and embroidered in
gold, which with wired edges outlined the shoulders of all dresses worn
on state occasions.</p>

<p>Pins and ribbons were first brought into use in the reign of
Elizabeth, and really to her interest in the subject of fashion we owe
much. Silk stockings amongst other things, such as cosmetics, face
washes and perfumes, and embroidered and scented gloves, and fans made
of ostrich or peacock feathers with gold and silver handles, were
adopted by the men as well as by the women.</p>

<p>Of the many head-dresses favoured by Elizabeth one resembled a
cushion, ornamented with jewels; another, known as a ship-tire, left
the neck and shoulders bare; and another, dubbed the tire valiant, was
made of many kerchiefs, so disposed as to allow only the nose, eyes,
and mouth to be visible.</p>

<p>In the early days of the sixteenth century dress in France was
somewhat simple, but about 1550 tastes altered and every kind of
trimming was eagerly sought and found, and the lappets, which became
a popular addition to the head-dress, displayed jewelled borders or
golden tassels in the shape of a flower. The hair fell in curls about
the face and on the neck, and in a long description which we have from
Rabelais, of a dress of the period in Paris, there is mention of a
beautiful bouquet of feathers, a panache, which matched the muff, and
was thickly spangled with gold. To him also we owe an excellent account
of crimson stockings with the edges embroidered three inches above the
knee, and of garters of elaborate detail to hold these, and of shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and slippers of crimson or violet velvet to complete them. Attire
consisted of a chemise worn beneath a corset of silk camlet, a hood of
silk, and above this a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cotte</i> in silver tissue embroidered in gold.
In summer the Parisian wore, instead of a dress, wraps made in a loose
burnous style of velvet seamed with pearls, and no costume was complete
without its rosary, its girdle, jewelled necklaces and bracelets. The
most popular head-dress was a velvet hood with a hanging curtain, and
the turban wound its graceful way above a network of pearls or precious
stones. Muffs received much attention and elaboration, fur and lace
and jewels alike being dedicated to their service, and in their depths
would nestle the dog or monkey or marmoset whose mistress counted
such a pet in her armoury of attractions. A description of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">robe
montante</i>, which appears to have been comparatively a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">n√©glig√©</i>, not
permitted the honour of attending Court functions, shows it cut square
in the neck, with a collar of fine cambric finished with a small ruff,
the sleeves, puffed and slashed and fitting tightly to the wrists,
being of a different material from the dress; and in France, as in
England, rank determined the length of the train, queens burdening
themselves with no less than six yards.</p>

<p>In the early days of this century turban head-dresses were popular
in Italy, and slashed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
puffed sleeves were trimmed with ribbon. It is interesting to note that
the women of Genoa were bound by law to wear a dress of plain cloth,
but that their under-garments were of the richest silks, and shoes and
hose were costly details. The sketch on page 59 shows an Italian lady
under attractive conditions, with a stomacher and collar traced with
a raised design of gold outlined with pearls, and puffed sleeves tied
with ribbons tagged with metal; and, covering her hair, is a close coif
edged with pearls. Italian also are the two heads illustrated, lace
and jewels and ribbons being used for their adornment. The Italian
gentleman wears a full-crowned cap of velvet, and a cloth coat showing
slashings and collar of velvet, the lawn frill inside the collar being
repeated at the wrists of the sleeves, whose detail of slashing may
well be left to the imagination.</p>

opposite, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sixteenth-century Spaniard is exploiting an unusual form of trunk,
in cut-out cloth, showing white beneath, and buttoned with straps on
to the hose. His white shirt is slashed, and from the double collar
falls a tassel; tassels are pendent from the drapery of the long
gold-bordered cloak, and a gold net appears beneath the characteristic
cap of velvet.</p>

<p>The picture on page 64 of Maximilian of fame shows him brave in
upstanding felt hat, encircled with flaunting feathers, and beneath
this a striped scarf is bound round his head, and the monstrous sleeves
have slashings of colour. Tassels dangle from the scarf beneath the
chin and over either ear, and bold bows assert themselves above one
knee, and claim their right to hold the folds of his sash in front.</p>

<p>A sixteenth-century sacque coat in its original sin&mdash;or
grace&mdash;appears illustrated on the left, with sleeves slashed and
the armholes bearing padded rolls on the top. The inner vest has a high
collar boned to stand out at the back, and the helmet-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
hat is trimmed with bands of braid buttoned with gold, with two
feathers waving at one side.</p>

</div>

<p>Another edition of the helmet-shaped hat, far less successful,
however, in the interests of beauty, decorates the right-hand figure,
which bears round the neck a wonderful ruff, and gives a capital idea
of a strange form of cape buttoned down the sleeve, gathered slightly
in the process, and bordered with a band of plain colour.</p>

<p>Fair and sweet looks the maiden on page 58
beneath the kilted frill of her cap, and her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
bodice shows her chemisette of white lawn tied in front with small
bows.</p>

<p>"I will ruffle it with the best of them" was distinctly the
determination of the valiant queen who smiles upon you on page 56. Lace
forms her huge collar and her pendent lappets, and tightly round her
throat sits a lace ruffle; an audacious feather stands rampant on top
of her crown, and beneath this is a cap bordered with jewels, curved at
one side to allow a good view of her curled head, where the flat cap of
jewels holds a golden pendant in the centre of her forehead.</p>

<p>Far more demure are the ruffle and cap which appear on page 55
beneath the closely-hooded mantle, and severity marks the net and lace
of the dame whose hair is entwined with pearls; and a typical Medici
collar of lace is elaborately wired to form a frame to the fair head,
upon which jewels and feathers alike disport themselves.</p>

<p>In this century fashion was playing the woman who often varies, and
La Bruy√®re in reviewing the situation says: "A fashion has no sooner
supplanted some other fashion than its place is taken by a new one,
which in turn makes way for the next, and so on; such is the feebleness
of our character. While these changes are taking place a century has
rolled away, relegating all this finery to the dominion of the past."
And writing in the twentieth century, I can see some satisfaction in
that.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="p5">IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</p>


<p>Familiarity has bred respect, even affection, for the typical
costume of Charles I.'s reign, and that unfortunate monarch himself,
depicted by Van Dyck in sombre coat and lace collar, is amongst the
dear intimacies of our daily life. Sir Peter Lely, who followed on
the footsteps of Van Dyck, left many modish records of his time, and
though he has been rated for dressing his nymphs in inappropriate
extravagances of fringes and embroidery, he undoubtedly clothed lovely
woman with an excellent fantasy, bestowing height and grace by the
length and simple disposition of his drapery. Mignard, the French
artist, also wrote a page in fashion's history in his paintings of the
Court ladies as Madonnas; covering the vanities of the sinner with the
mantle of the saint, he was much sought after for his pains.</p>

<p>The main features of feminine costume in Charles I.'s reign may
be realised in recalling the dresses which have so often appeared to
delight us in the various presentations of stage plays of his period;
the bodice is tight, the basque square and tabbed, and round the waist
are a few folds of silk fastened into a rosette in the front; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lace collar falls from the neck to the shoulders in deep points, and
the ringleted hair bears a ribbon rosette, or is surmounted by a plumed
hat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_067.jpg" width="500" height="318" alt="" title="A FEATHER AND A CHICKEN SKIN FAN" />
<div class="caption"><p>A FEATHER AND A CHICKEN-SKIN FAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Henrietta, Queen of Charles I., is accredited with the introduction
of female labour for clothing the outer woman, and from her day
mantle-making ranked among female occupations. But the tailor still
ruled supreme, and though the sex of the milliner was the more
sympathetic, it was left to the next century to popularise feminine
services.</p>

<p>The farthingale extended its circumference in the reign of James I.,
when much effort was taken to suppress it, for the King declared it
occupied more room at his court than he himself. The ruff flourished,
but less obtrusively than in the preceding reigns, and in its place was
adopted what was known as a fall, a loose band overhanging the top of a
wide collar starched and frilled at the base&mdash;a fancy some merry
writer of the period noted with the epigram:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A question 'tis why women wear a fall?</div>
  <div class="i0">The truth on't is, to pride they're given all,</div>
  <div class="i0">And pride, the proverb says, will have a fall.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>With the farthingale were worn long sleeves, lace coifs, and fluted
basques, and stomachers; and later the long sleeves were replaced by
those reaching the elbow, made in puffs tied with bows or tightly
fitting and bordered with frills. Beneath the panier of the full skirt,
which was trimmed with many bands of gold and embroidery, appeared
a frilled apron, and the bodices were high at the back, and cut
square in front, and over the shoulders was worn a scarf. Muffs were
indispensable, and heads were decorated in monstrous disproportion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_068.jpg" width="300" height="450" alt="" title="A FULL APRON" />
<div class="caption"><p>A FULL APRON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The kings' favourites in France influenced dress by their caprices,
which made to some extent for beauty, not conspicuously evident when
the <em>fontanges</em> head-decoration was in vogue. This was a polyglot
erection which owed its birth to the fact that the famous beauty,
losing her hat one day in the hunting-field, tied her hair with her
garter. The <em>fontanges</em> extended its glories to a framework of wire
half a yard in height, which was divided into several tiers, each being
covered with a different material; ribbon, chenille, pearls, flowers,
and muslin were all brought into service, and beneath these a cluster
of curls fell on the forehead. Each tier might take a different name,
and amongst these, duke, cabbage, cat, organ-pipe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and mouse were chosen with as much rhyme as reason. But the christening
of fashions was a common habit, and when Paris was reduced to misery
by the Ligue, and depression was written large upon the dress, which,
cut square and heavy in style, bore about it a suggestiveness of
architecture, colours were distinguished by such quaint names as "Dying
Monkey," "The Sick Spaniard," etc. Like the girl in some comic opera,
"I wonder why?"</p>

<p>Mlle. de Ninon and Mesdames de Montespan and de Maintenon each
inspired the names of a coiffure, a crown, and a cap, the last lady
giving its title to a head-dress in the form of a scarf entwining a
helmet. The battle of Steinkirk stood sponsor to a cravat and to a
three-cornered fichu trimmed with gold and silver fringes; and the
"Ninon" coiffure was parted in the front and flowed in curls at either
side, the back being held by a ribbon.</p>

<p>No such distinction was gained by the English "mistresses" and
maids of honour, whose names and escapades were legion; nor did they
seek much individuality in their clothes, confident that the fashions
prevailing were sufficient to excite the envy of the one sex and the
admiration of the other; yet Lady Castlemaine, Miss Hamilton, Miss
Warmestre, Miss Jennings, Miss Temple, Miss Price, Miss Stewart, and
all the rest of the merry gang, were slaves of the mirror, and the joys
of the masquerade were high in their favour, and for this no costume
was too extravagantly absurd or too absurdly extravagant to obtain
their satisfaction.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_070.jpg" width="500" height="459" alt="" title="THE LACE COMMODE" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE LACE COMMODE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The distinguishing feature of fashion was the
lace commode, which prevailed ubiquitously; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
simplest charms are easily realised by the pictures on these pages,
where, too, are evident examples of the <em>chopine</em> and the clogs, whose
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pas de fascination</i> were executed under such disadvantages. High heels
were conspicuous everywhere, but it was left to Italy to have the
honour of popularising the most ridiculous fashion of the <em>chopines</em>
or stilted clogs, which asserted themselves at different heights,
mostly outrageous, beneath a covering of gauffered leather, a commodity
which looks like the modern poker-work. The idea of the <em>chopines</em> was
imported from Turkey to Italy and thence to England, where, however,
it is well to mention, it received but the scantiest consideration.
The height of the <em>chopines</em> served to indicate rank, and some were of
such monstrous inconvenience that they necessitated their wearer being supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on either side while she walked. Every conceivable device was sought
for the decoration of the shoes, and a frenzy of extravagance broke out
in buckles of gold, silver, paste, and diamonds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_071.jpg" width="560" height="240" alt="" title="CLOGS AND CHOPINES" />
<div class="caption"><p>CLOGS AND CHOPINES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Charles II., from long residence in France, had much sympathy
with fashion, which was beloved of men and women, who patronised the
lace collar, the muff, the fanciful buttons, and feathers with equal
enthusiasm. The sexes, too, shared a love for curls and the hats of
broad brims, whose flopping habits proved so inconvenient that they
were turned up first at one side and then at the other, and lastly at
the back, when they developed into the well-loved cocked hat. Hat-bands
were prominently important, made either of cord in silver or gold or
silk, and glorified by the addition of jewels for the gay and witty
Duke of Buckingham, who changed his love as often as his coat, and
showed a prodigal appreciation of the arts of gallantry and costume.
He led many of the fashions for men, and added to these a conspicuous
number of ribbons, buckles, and cravats. He spared his friends neither
his wit nor his money, and Dryden epitomised his fall: "He had his
jest, while they had his estate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Two manufactures which were accorded prominent attention in these
times were the linen and button manufactures, the former being made
from the yarn obtained in Ireland, while for the latter, inspiration
came from various parts of the Continent. Steel, brass and copper,
and jet were used to make these buttons, and their value is quoted
from 3d. to 140 guineas per gross. Fairholt, writing on the subject,
says: "Buttons were made sometimes like a picture, the back dark, upon
which, in various degrees of relief, were placed in ivory or bone,
figures and flowers. Others showed elegant patterns in white upon
gilt, and many most tasteful appeared on Court suits, these being made
of mother-of-pearl or ivory, the centre embellished with patterns in
gilt."</p>

<p>Muslin came generally into use under such flimsy conditions that
it was described by some writer as costing "some 30s. per yard, and
being but the shadow of a commodity when procured." India was the happy
hunting-ground for muslins till Flanders and Germany took up its cause
and, in the eighteenth century, Bolton and Glasgow granted it special
attention.</p>

<p>Elegance characterised many of the prevailing modes, which
encouraged a conspicuous simplicity, when the superabundance of
jewellery and most elaborate trimmings decreased to some extent, and
a simple string of pearls was worn round the neck, and the studied
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">n√©glig√©</i> became the highest expression of coquetry. The hair was
curled into ringlets, and amidst these nestled a single rose or a
chaplet of pearls; and at the sides it was slightly puffed over
the ears, with some support of pad or wire to secure its righteous
bearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_073.jpg" width="250" height="404" alt="" title="A MOB CAP" />
<div class="caption"><p>A MOB-CAP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Women of the lower classes wore muslin caps with ribbons twisted
round them, but what lovely hats were obtainable by the wealthy! Above
the long ringlets huge plumes waved over a hat of straw, or the velvet
cap would be covered with feathers. Hair-dressing was a fine art, and
many were the styles in which the ringlets were treated; they would
be cut to graduated lengths, short in front and long at the back, or
would only obtain at each side of the face and round the neck, the
main portion of hair being drawn up on the top; or the hair was cut
rather short, and curled over the head, while black ribbons and pearls
decorated it.</p>

<p>The cultivation of beauty was earnest and intelligent, and all
ladies of high degree owned amongst their retinue starchers and
brushers, and the position of patches had a political significance
according to the opinions of the fair patched. The patch, by the way,
was brought into fame about 1655; though, owing its first existence to
the times of the Romans, it cannot conscientiously claim this to be the
date of its birth.</p>

<p>The house coats and gowns and petticoats were quilted, and being
made of silk from Japan, China, and Persia and trimmed with Flemish
lace, may be freely granted a cosmopolitan sympathy. An attractive
description of a dress of this time tells of a musk-coloured silk shot
with silver, with trails of silver flowers, trimmed with white bone
lace, whose importation from foreign lands excited the displeasure of
Charles II. Lace was a trium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>phant
feature, being indispensable for the commodes, the frilled cravats,
and the collars. It was useful alike to men and women, and beautiful
specimens of lace were enriched with gold and silver under the auspices
of Venice and Spain. Mazarin had, in endeavouring to stay the popular
greed for lace, caused a small social revolution, and the French bought
lace from England. Colbert was wiser in his generation, for he set
up a factory at Alen√ßon, and Brussels and Mechlin devoted themselves
assiduously and most successfully to lace.</p>

<p>Amongst the vain efforts of an earlier period in France was one to
kill fashion, whose reckless prodigality had been voted insupportable,
and like to bring ruin to the people. A contemporary print shows the
funeral of fashion, the design being of fashion led by four women
and followed by a crowd of workpeople, while a sarcophagus in the
background bears the following epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Here lies under this picture, for having deserved it,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fashion, which caused so much madness in France.</div>
  <div class="i0">Death has put superfluity to death,</div>
  <div class="i0">And will soon revive abundance.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Louis XIV. was so appreciative of the charms of costume that he
would distribute all materials, silks and satins and brocades, to his
courtiers, and exercise some jurisdiction over the way these were to
be made. Painting on silk and satin was amongst the novelties of his
reign, but embroidery still held the affections of the prodigal, and at
a f√™te at Vaux, Mlle. de la Valli√®re is recorded to have worn a gown
of white with golden stars and leaves in Persian stitch, and a blue
sash tied in a large knot upon her bosom, while her fair waving hair,
entwined with flowers and pearls, fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in profusion about her neck and shoulders, and her gloves were of
cream-coloured lace. A gold dress embroidered with gold is also
included in the chronicles, and there were double borders of gold and
silver to many of the under-skirts, which were made of silk or satin
with a long train which was carried over the left arm. Bodices were
trimmed with galon, ribbon, and lace, and Madame de S√©vign√© writes of
the "transparent gown," whose descendant lives to-day in our lace and
jet frocks over tissue.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_075.jpg" width="200" height="256" alt="" title="GLOVE WITH JEWELLED GAUNTLET" />
<div class="caption"><p>GLOVE WITH JEWELLED GAUNTLET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Duchess of Bourgogne showed her nice taste in a gown of silver
tissue with gold flowers outlined with orange and green, and again in
a grey damask bordered with silver; and the same record tells of a
mantilla of gold Spanish point lace, and of a coat and skirt of cloth
of silver laced with silver, and worn with diamonds and rubies. "All
werry capital," as Sam Weller might have observed, had he only heard of
them.</p>

<p>Amongst the desirable and the desired was a blue camlet waistcoat
embroidered and fringed with silver. Spanish broadcloth of the very
finest description was dedicated to waistcoats and to the hunting and
riding costumes which were as much masculine as feminine, and mainly
picturesque, with small rapiers to emphasise the manly tone. All hats
were feathered, and the cravats frilled, a state of affairs which
excited comment from that irrepressible critic Pepys, who granted it
small admiration when he wrote: "Walking in the galleries at White Hall
I find the ladies of honour dressed in their riding garbs with coats
and doublets and deep skirts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
just for all the world like mine, and buttoned their doublets up to
the breast, with periwigs and hats, so that only for a long petticoat
dragging under their men's coats nobody could take them for women in
any point whatever. It was an odd sight, and a sight which did not
please me."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_076.jpg" width="390" height="600" alt="" title="A RIDING COSTUME" />
<div class="caption"><p>A RIDING COSTUME.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But Pepys, in his immortal diary, did not pay proper respect to
fashion. He commented on the clothes of the ladies, it is true, but
he showed a lamentable vagueness, if not careless indifference, about
their details. Doubtless his notes on dress were quite satisfying to
his masculine mind, but I find them practically useless in assuaging
the deepest emotions of feminine curiosity. However, I know from him
and other sources that Nell Gwynn, the careless slattern, wore a
cart-wheel hat when delivering a prologue in a play, and furthermore
that she "looked pretty" on one occasion when Pepys passed her as she
stood at her lodging door in "smock-sleeves and a bodice,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
whatever such description might please to mean. Colours, shapes, and
materials this inimitable gossip ignored as unimportant; yet it may
be written down to his credit that he confessed he was moved when he
saw Lady Castlemaine's smocks and linen petticoats hanging out to dry
in the Privy garden at White Hall, laced with the richest lace at the
bottom which ever he saw, and he vows, "they did me good to look at
them"; and so much may we count for grace, even though I sigh to think
of the number of tucks and gaugings he failed to mention.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that, after that painful interview with the riding
garb of the ladies at White Hall, he turned the other way and went back
to the Privy garden and his joyful contemplation of Lady Castlemaine's
under-wear.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="p5">IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</p>


<p>Marie Stuart shares with Madame de Pompadour the honour of standing
godmother to fashions which will be known through the ages by their
names. The former luckless lady will ever be associated with that
coif which is pointed in the front, and curves at either side, while
the latter stands eternal sponsor to the rolled coiffure which turns
back from the face over a high pad. There may perhaps be other glories
better worth attainment, but nobody respectfully imbued with the
importance of dress can venture to assert that these ladies lived in
vain.</p>

</div>

<p>And in a minor degree their privilege has been shared by others. The
art of Gainsborough and of Watteau has immortalised a hat, a pleat, and
a flowered sac; Madame du Barry has a special shade of pink consecrated
to her memory; the lace collar which expands round the shoulders had at
its christening no less a person than Catherine de Medici; and Napoleon
gave his name to a hat. Of the more modern garments I could take as
examples the cardigan, a waistcoat of wool named after a noble lord;
and I could recall that another noble lord, one Spencer, introduced a
short woollen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
jacket; and that the great general Garibaldi is
responsible for the loose shirt with open collar;
and that a peculiar kind of open-sleeved bed-jacket,
known as the nightingale, is sacred to the heroic
efforts of that devoted nurse who did such splendid
duty at the Crimea.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_079.jpg" width="500" height="464" alt="" title="MADAME DE POMPADOUR" />
<div class="caption"><p>MADAME DE POMPADOUR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Madame de Pompadour represented in her century everything that was
most beautiful, most desirable, and most alluring, and she played her
part as pioneer of fashion with a fierce, reckless enthusiasm, and,
from the crown of her rolled hair to the tip of her embroidered shoes,
expressed conclusively the prodigal and the pretty. Upon her feet she
bestowed considerable attention, and narrow pointed shoes were amongst
her innovations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
she would have them decked with every conceivable conceit, and kick her
red heels in defiance of public opinion. A pair of her shoes are even
now kept in the Museum at Cluny, and these are embroidered in a design
of green foliage, outlined with silver, clasped with silver buckles
glittering with old paste. Fans also were amongst her weaknesses; she
had these of every size and shape, with long handles which could not be
folded, and mounts of carved and decorated ivory, some of her Chinese
fans being worth a small fortune.</p>

<p>Mrs. Delany's letters may be the foundation for a liberal education
in the art of costume as practised in England in the eighteenth
century, and her description of Lady Huntingdon's dress at a Court ball
is as vivid as remarkable, reflecting at once credit on the Boswell and
the inspiration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Her petticoat was of black velvet embroidered with chenille,
the pattern a large stone vase filled with ramping flowers, which
spread almost over the breadth of the petticoat from the top to the
bottom; between each vase of flowers was a pattern of gold shells
and foliage embossed and most heavily rich. The gown was
white satin embroidered also with chenille mixed with gold, no
vase on the sleeve, but two or three on the tail; it was a most
laboured piece of finery, the pattern much properer for a stucco
staircase than the apparel of a lady.</p></blockquote>

<p>She also writes the description of a dress she is going to wear at
the wedding of Princess Anne (George II.'s eldest daughter) and Prince
William of Nassau and Orange in 1734:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have got my wedding garment ready; 'tis a brocaded lute-string
white ground, with great ramping flowers in shades of purples, reds,
and greens. I gave thirteen shillings a yard: which looks better than
it describes, and it will make a show. I shall wear it with dark purple
and gold ribbon, and a black hood for decency's sake.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>And again she describes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Princess of Orange's dress was the prettiest thing that ever
was seen&mdash;a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps de robe</i>&mdash;that is, in plain English, a
stiff bodied gown. The eight peers' daughters that held up her train
were in the same sort of dress, all white and silver, with great
quantities of jewels in their hair and long locks; some of them very
pretty and well-shaped, it is a most becoming dress. The Princess wore
a mantua and petticoat, white damask with the finest embroidery of
rich embossed gold. On one side of her head she had a green diamond of
vast size, the shape of a pear, and two pearls prodigiously large that
were fastened to wires and hung loose in her hair; on the other side
small diamonds prettily disposed; her ear-rings, necklace, and bars to
her stays all extravagantly fine, presents of the Prince of Orange to
her.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same letter she says: "The Queen commended my clothes."</p>

<p>In the reign of Louis XV. the English borrowed all their fashions
from France. The beautiful Austrian, Marie Antoinette, came in a blaze
of splendour to charm and astonish every one, and the loveliest ladies
of her Court, headed by her friend the Princess de Lamballe, vied with
her in inaugurating a reign of costume which was to have been "roses,
roses all the way." Alas, however, thorns made themselves felt only
too soon. In her early days the Queen seemed to have no care save that
noble lover of hers and her dressmaker; and she studied the minor
details of the etiquette of her Court so assiduously that we have the
amusing history of her disrobing, surrounded by a bevy of ladies, each
taking their turn in handing their royal mistress her chemise.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette's delicate beauty called for pale colours, and
green and pink and puce were amongst the favoured tones, the last
mentioned taking its name from no more attractive source than the back
of a flea. Her earlier dresses dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>played
stiff pointed bodices with stomachers, held with little tied bows
of velvet, and paniers bunched liberally on the hips to show the
under-dress of lace, bordered with flounces, headed and festooned with
roses. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d√©colletage</i> was square, and the elbow sleeves had frills
of lace.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_082.jpg" width="500" height="583" alt="" title="MARIE ANTOINETTE" />
<div class="caption"><p>MARIE ANTOINETTE.</p></div>

<p>The paniers grew daily in size, and evoked the
inevitable denunciation which waits punctually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
upon the heels of any favourite of fashion. Marie Antoinette varied
her corsets to suit her bodices, therein showing much wisdom, since
obviously the short-waisted bodice asks beneath it a stay totally
different from that needed beneath a bodice which is cut in a long
point in front. Her fichus were as elaborate as dainty, and the method
of their adjustment varied in half-a-dozen different ways&mdash;they
would be crossed over the bust and tied at the back, or tucked into
the waistband, or fastened high on the bust with bunches of ribbons or
flowers.</p>

<p>No garment more attractive can be imagined than the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d√©shabill√©
galant</i>: a teagown of hers which was ruched from the neck round to
the short train, and displayed a frilled front of lace or muslin tied
with ribbons, and daintily flounced round the hem. Silks, satins,
and brocades were used to make these, but shot silk enjoyed supreme
patronage; and the favourite dressmaker, Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Bertin, was a heroine of vast importance, a genius of diplomatic
habits, who played most successfully upon the fancies of her royal
patron, bringing her every day some new device in paniers or sumptuous
train which it was impossible to resist.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette adored feathers, and the panache flourished under
her favour, and boldly survived her mother's reprimand. "You have
sent me the picture of an actress, not of a Queen," she wrote, upon
receiving a picture of her daughter in a prodigious head-dress of
feathers and jewels. Jewels, it is well known, were amongst Marie
Antoinette's weaknesses. Did not they inspire that romance of the
Queen's necklace which has pursued us for many years in various works
of fiction and drama, and is still regarded as vitally interesting?</p>

<p>But let me return to England, and repeat that French fashions were
treated with servility, if not with complete success, for somehow
the English women were too ponderously exact in their method of
adjustment to toy triumphantly with the many accessories of lace, and
ribbon, and velvet, and buckles, and ruchings which were essentially
the distinguishing features of these styles. And, also, the small
feet of the French women encouraged much attention to dainty shoes,
with coloured heels and embroidered toes, and to these the national
deficiencies or superfluities of the English women were rather a
drawback. However, they followed the French fashions at a distance, and
bestowed most earnest attention upon hair-dressing, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
assumed formidable proportions during this period, and rose higher and
ever higher, to be topped by ornaments as incongruous, as hideous. The
skilful hair-dresser who could "build" a head was at a premium; the art
of hair-dressing being reckoned as one of the most important, and as
rare as difficult. No lady's maid, however clever, was entrusted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
this difficult task, and very complicated was the work of constructing
the popular coiffure, which was piled half a yard high, and decked
with pads, and false hair, and curls so stuck down and plastered with
pomades that they might hold for weeks without being pulled down.
So monumental were these erections that collapsible frames had to
be made, so that ladies could pass through doors and get into their
sedan-chairs. Windmills and ships in full sail, fruit and balls were
added to the pile, and ostrich plumes nodded boldly amongst a profusion
of ribbons and flowers.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A VARIETY OF HEAD-DRESSES ADOPTED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The aristocratic was of course the only class that could afford
these most elaborate styles, where so much curling and frizzing
appeared in large masses in front that iron hairpins were used to keep
these in place at the top lest they should fall crushed beneath their
own weight.</p>

<p>The hats were worn rather far back to show these curls, and many had
long ends of ribbon hanging down at the back, and others had low crowns
and wide brims trimmed with flowers. What was known as a "fly" cap was
a large butterfly edged with jewels, and crownless hats became the
fashion; invented so as not to spoil the high coiffure, they boasted
nothing but brim, and were delegated to do duty only in the finest
weather. The calash, which resembles comically the hood of a baby's
perambulator, could be drawn back or over the face at will, and was
tied with strings. Straw hats obtained, as well as those of silk and
velvet, and a mob-cap created such a sensation at Ranelagh, the popular
resort of the moment, that all the women were crying out for one before
the sun had risen and set again. The mob-cap was made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
blonde, flowers, ribbons, and muslin; but so great was the craze for
hair-dressing and head decoration that every sort of cap and hat
gained some attention in turn, and amongst them were hoods of lace or
velvet, edged with fur, and cr√™pe turbans held with jewels, with a
group of feathers waving proudly on the top. The famous "Devonshire"
hat of black with white feathers showed well the curls and rolls, which
extended to the back of the head when it had been realised that the
straight clean upward sweep to the top pinnacle of the puffs was a
disadvantage to the contour not to be permitted. Of the prettiest of
the fashions were the broad-brimmed hats of black chip, and the Rubens
hats of black velvet; and the straight-crowned gipsy hats were really
quite charming; but the winged Mercury hat received more popularity
than it deserved.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A CAP AND HOOD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The perruques of the men, even when fresh from the embraces of the
curl-papers, must have looked very insignificant by the side of the
huge erections which towered above the women, who did not scruple in
their martyrdom to sit on the floor of a hackney coach so that the
head-dress should not be disarranged, or to go to bed with their hair
surrounded by a basket, or held in position by pillows and tapes.
Happily the dancing of the period was of a stately kind, for the
coiffure would have brooked no such frivolities as the "two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>-step,"
and the uproarious lancers of to-day would have made short work of the
hair-dresser's labour of time and money.</p>

<p>The question of complexion was seriously studied, the colour of
the chin and cheeks being carefully suited to the gowns. Patches
were lavishly indulged in in England and France, the eyebrows
were blacked and even false, and China, Spain, and Portugal all
contributed&mdash;for a consideration&mdash;rouges and white lead
and wash balls, scented lard and lip salves, and toilet waters and
soaps.</p>

<p>The fan was an indispensable complement to every gown, and its best
conduct was an art which might well have been added to the scholastic
curriculum for women, always supposing the like in existence. The fans
were made of chicken skin and painted; and chicken skin also had the
privilege, with lace and an embroidery of gold and silver, in making
gloves and mittens for evening wear.</p>

<p>Tight-lacing was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de rigueur</i>, and it is indeed impossible to
imagine any discomfort omitted from the toilet. I cannot picture
conditions more entirely unpleasant than to glaze the face with paint
and grease of red and black, to decorate it at intervals with devices
of sticking plaster, to supply it with false eyebrows, and to mount
on the head some pounds' weight of stuffed hair, while reducing the
waist at least three inches below the natural size, expanding the hips
with whalebone and hoops, compressing the feet into narrow shoes, and
carefully studying every movement of the arm so as to hold a fan at a
significant and becoming angle. And to add to all this, the dresses
were of the stiffest brocades, decked with gold and silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
embroideries and tinselled fringes, velvet and fur
increasing the burden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_b_089.jpg" width="350" height="329" alt="" title="SOME STICKS" />
<div class="caption"><p>SOME STICKS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The excessive elaboration of the hoods and the scarves and the
aprons dangling with silver tassels and fringes was responsible for
some criticism from Beau Nash, the autocrat of Bath, where he had
established the strictest rules of dress and procedure, covering all
delinquencies of conduct with a bearing of convincing dignity set in
an atmosphere of punctilious etiquette. Goldsmith gives an instance of
the despotic rule of Nash, and of the special liberties he arrogated to
himself. "I have known him on a ball-night strip even the Duchess of
Q." (the "Kitty beautiful," as the poet Prior called this Duchess of
Queensberry), "and throw her apron at one of the hinder benches among
the ladies' women, observing that none but Abigails appeared in white
aprons."</p>

<p>Women had indeed to suffer in those days to attain what they were
pleased to call the beautiful, and it is quite a relief to remember
the moment when Marie Antoinette took a sudden caprice to appear
without hoops in a soft satin gown with wide sleeves, which set the
fashion in London as well as in France. For a short time only, however,
such moderation ruled, and the hoops came back larger than ever in
1784, when the Duchess of Cumberland swept the floor in five yards of
brocade, and a stomacher blazing stiffly with jewels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The pastoral simplicity of the Petit Trianon should have really made
more lasting impression than it did. For the Court ladies played at
milkmaids under the rule of their farmer Queen, and churned butter with
their own fair hands, and found a wide field for dainty disguises in
rustic and ruinous simplicity. The peasant girls' dresses of stuffs and
muslin were glorified by rich silks and muslin and challis decked with
lace fichus and crowned with rose-coloured and be-ribboned straw hats,
and embroidered holland and Persian cambric were affected economies no
less expensive than the maize-coloured silk and striped green and white
satin of avowed prodigality. The Trianon was a happy hunting-ground
for flirtation, but that is another story, indeed a great many;
but it served too as a pretext for innumerable new frocks, and the
colour-prints of the time convincingly prove the dainty possibilities
afforded by the artifice of simplicity allied to a nice taste in
ribbons.</p>

<p>We have to go back to the days of Marie Antoinette for a practice
which aroused some interest and amusement when a dressmaker in London
last year was fired with a desire to revive it. Gowns were invested
with the power to express special emotion, and Moli√®re held the notion
up to ridicule in his famous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pr√©cieuses</i>. Long narrow shoes with the
seam at the heel, whose socket was studded with jewels, were called
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">venez-y-voir</i>; and this suggestion of forwardness was again evident
in a ribbon which went by the name of "marked attention." Other
absurdities often quoted were the gown known as the "stifled sigh,"
trimmed with "superfluous regrets," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the cap of "assured conquest," and a muff of "momentary agitation."</p>

<p>Towards the end of the reign of Louis XVI. the low head-dress came
into fashion, the short curls being gathered into a knot of ribbon or
"catogan," and the fair moderated their transports for powdered hair
which had abundantly obtained in white, reddish blonde, and grey.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette knew all there was to know of the art of dress, and
recognising the supreme charm of caprice, she would ring every change
in turn; and perhaps she never looked more exquisitely beautiful than
when, her hair powdered and her face faintly lined by sorrow, she met
the scaffold and the mob on the last day of her existence, in her plain
black dress and simple white fichu.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="p5">IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</p>


<p>On trying to set down a chronicle of dress as it lived in the
earlier part of the nineteenth century, my mind becomes immediately
obsessed with short-waisted gowns; and a vision of the hapless
Josephine&mdash;whose name, by the way, I should have added to the list
of the few who have stood godmother to a fashion&mdash;immediately
appears before me in her graceful short-skirted evening dress with its
high Empire belt.</p>

<p>That all women kill the style they love might with truth be said of
the enthusiasm which raged for that Empire belt, for it grew smaller by
degrees and grotesquely less when it commenced its career immediately
beneath the arm, pushing the bust under the throat, presenting but
an apology for a bodice, and needing the completely slim figure to
withstand its liberties with any degree of decorum. Decorum was,
however, not among its ambitions.</p>

<p>For walking wear the high waist was no less a desideratum, and
cloth skirts, long and full, were completed by short velvet coats with
long tight sleeves, vests of white, and stocks of black. The whole
was crowned by small hats with feathers on one side, or high hats of
masculine convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
made of cream-coloured beaver. Napoleon, following in the footsteps of
many of his predecessors in the profession of Royalty, showed a nice
appreciation of the charm of costume, being alternately disapproving
and encouraging in his criticisms, and always leaning towards the side
of prodigality.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;">

<div class="caption"><p>SOME QUAINT EXAMPLES OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY HEADGEAR.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Princess Pauline Buonaparte made dress the religion of her salon,
and there are records of her audacious grace in a fancy costume as
Minerva, and of one of her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soir√©e</i> gowns which expressed the last word
of extravagance in pink tulle over pink satin, trimmed with marabout
feathers, and diamond <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">agrafes</i>, with the bodice encrusted, and every
seam of the skirt glistening, with diamonds.</p>

<p>In England Queen Charlotte evinced a decided predilection for the
greatcoat and the cloth pelisse with a velvet collar, crowned by the
circular hat of beaver, veiled with green muslin; and much favour was
granted to such masculine properties as the silk cravat and the boot
with the high military heel, the feminine situation being saved only by
the sprigged lace veil. An alternative to the pelisse was a garment not
unlike the Greek chiton, which, however, never received the attention
bestowed upon the boxcloth driving-coat with heavy capes, and the manly
etceteras to do it honour or dishonour.</p>

<p>It goes to prove my suspicion that there is a leaven of contrariety
in the soul of women, when I remember that beneath these was worn a
cambric or lawn dress of most diaphanous detail, and so close-fitting
that the feminine form, unfortunately not being divine, lacked under
its influence the best grace of reticence. Besides being of cambric and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
lawn, these skimpy dresses were made of clear silk net over a
foundation of white satin, and all were very short in the waist and in
the skirt, which was trimmed with rouleaux of satin.</p>

<p>In warm weather the thick cloaks were discarded for the short
cloaks and mantles shaped as the Zouave, or in the short sacque style
extending only to the waist. A spencer in a contrasting shade of silk
achieved popularity and was considered the fitting complement to the
muslin gown; and about the year 1814 this was made with full sleeves
and upstanding collar and worn over the morning dress, which was either
cut high to the neck, or filled in with a ruff and kerchief of lace
or muslin. A fold of muslin also did service, crossed in front of the
popular evening bodice, whose <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d√©colletage</i> was more remarkable for its
breach than its observance of the best ideals of modesty.</p>

<p>A favourite ornament was a gold chain and heart, which would open to
reveal the eye of a lover, relative, or friend executed on ivory and
bordered with enamel; and this limned eye is a love token which seems
to be coming once more into fashion.</p>

<p>French fashions again became the mode at the beginning of the
century, when white chemisettes were worn with the Swiss petticoat,
and powder fell into disuse, and the hair was long or short in curls
falling over the face, a style of coiffure which was followed by the
crop, in favour of which even the most tolerant can find little to
put forward. With the crop a narrow fillet was placed round the head,
holding a rose in front, or over it an immense panache of feathers
would nod with foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
monotony. The cropped head had for its successor the style known as
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la chinoise</i> for which the hair was tightly dragged back from the
forehead, with a long ringlet falling at the side, a plait set in a
cluster of roses crowning the top, which was further decorated with
gold pins, tasselled with small gold balls.</p>

<p>Many garments had foreign names. A robe known as the Mameluke had
a Delta trimming; a coiffure adorned with jewels and a double row of
beads on the forehead was dedicated to Egypt; and Austerlitz expressed
a nankeen-coloured gown with blue trimmings. And there were caps
recognised as Patmos and Tyrolean; and there were Spanish dresses, and
Etruscan borders to Pyrenean robes. The Patmos cap had charms which
easily pushed it to the height of success, when it was made of satin
and lace cut into points at the front, was covered with diamonds, and
had tassels falling at either side.</p>

<p>Beau Brummel, as he walked upon the Pantiles, carefully cultivating
towards everybody an insolence that would not be tolerated nowadays,
even in the richest member of the Stock Exchange, laid down the law of
dress for men. About 1811 he held supreme sway, and was the "Arbiter
Elegantarium," contributing doubtless to the gaiety of nations many a
new stock and new button. It was not long after this, however, that
man gave up fashion as a bad job, ultimately contenting himself for
his adornment with the details of his waistcoat and the cut of his
whiskers, begging the question at first by full-skirted coats with
velvet collars, frilled shirts and stock ties, tasselled canes, and
light beaver hats, then gradually drifting into the safe harbour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
broadcloth and linen, where he permitted himself selection only in the
colour of his necktie and the option of the hard or the soft hat. Gone
are his glories of brocade and satin and tight breeches, which revealed
silk stockings and buckled shoes; banished are the lace ruffles,
the nankeen, the mulberry, and the blue cloth with brass buttons;
diminished are the curled heads; and frankly I regret all these as
losses to the beauty as well as to the humour of social existence.</p>

<p>It was in the earliest days of the nineteenth century that
artificial flowers began to obtain considerable popularity, and they
were used in the hair and on the bodices and in festoons on the skirts,
and on the hems of trains. After the return of Napoleon from Elba,
violets were the conspicuous fashion, being regarded as an emblem of
Imperialism, and no faithful follower was seen without a bunch of
violets in her dress; while the ladies of royal sympathies would, in
honour of Louis XVIII., decorate their gowns with eighteen tucks, and
supply their cashmere shawls with vermilion borders.</p>

<p>Shawls, the manufacture of which had begun in England in the
eighteenth century, were in great request later in the century. They
were made of cashmere, in imitation of the Indian shawls, which were
respectfully considered articles of luxury and importance during all
the days of Queen Victoria, who chose these as wedding gifts for the
brides she delighted to honour.</p>

<p>But I progress too fast.</p>

<p>After the battle of Waterloo, fashion decidedly changed, and the
clinging gown, with its skimpy skirt hanging from a short belt or
Empire bodice, was discarded in favour of a much-trimmed dress standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
well away from the figure, and fancy would work its elaborate
will on the trimming of these skirts with scollops, many-coloured
embroideries, fringes and gold braid. The bodice still remained a minor
quantity, supplied with two short puffed sleeves and filled to the
bust or somewhat below it with a jewelled clasp or some decoration of
embroidery or lace, whose indiscretions were presumably to be concealed
beneath a dainty scarf of silk or coloured gauze, an elegance which
failed in its duties lamentably, and hung limply over the arm as if
ashamed of its delinquencies.</p>

<p>The fashionable outdoor dress could hardly have been suitable to
the English climate, unless indeed its habits have altered strangely,
and its detractors have reason for their abuse. The loose robe was of
jaconet muslin open at the neck and covered with embroidery, and round
the shoulders would hang the scarf, usually dropping to the waist, and
held in the hollow of the elbow; and on the head appeared a French cap
of blonde lace trimmed with ribbons.</p>

<p>In the 'thirties, dress was merely a travesty of the 'twenties; huge
sleeves and stiffened petticoats were universal, and the tight-fitting
bodices, cut with sloping shoulders, gave a thin flat appearance to
the waist, further accentuated by the ballooning sleeves, setting
closely to the wrist. The skirts were short, and still further enhanced
the immense effect of the sleeves; and round the waist a plain band
added angularity to the outline. Revers, shaped like capes at the back
and pointed in the front, were on day and evening bodices alike, and
pelerines of all kinds established their popularity, being tucked into
the waist, or having wide long ends crossed at the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
or front. Blonde lace was a favourite trimming to all gowns; and a
style of dress that took the fancy for a short time was known as the
"tunic." This was made with a sleeveless bodice and pointed shoulders,
the under-dress being two inches longer and of a colour different
from the skirt, which was open in the front. Bright colours were very
popular, but, on the whole, the spirit of costume was chastened, and
muffs, fans, bouquets, and parasols became considerably smaller.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/i_b_099.jpg" width="303" height="600" alt="" title="LADY BLESSINGTON" />
<div class="caption"><p>LADY BLESSINGTON.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most conspicuous garments in the earliest days of Queen Victoria
were the shawl-shaped cloak, the circular cape, and the crossover made
of either embroidered cr√™pe or taffeta, and bearing on its borders a
fringe or some frill of lace. Beneath these the sleeves dropped lower
and lower from the shoulder, and extended their fulness from elbow to
wrist; their top was tight and plain, or edged with two little frills,
and the billow beneath was expressed in white lawn. The fichu in
cambric or lawn was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
feature of nearly every bodice, the only alternative being a double
collar, which turned down at the neck.</p>

<p>The outstanding petticoat was ubiquitous, skirts over it being
single and trimmed with flounces, or double and dividing in the centre,
to show a contrasting under-skirt. Kerchiefs and capes were draped
over low dresses, and berthas were important features in the tulle or
tarletan gown, which was festooned and flounced, tied with ribbons,
one skirt being looped up over another with more ingenuity than
elegance.</p>

<p>The bonnet poked its brim into an audacious spoon, tilting upwards
to reveal a trimming beneath of quillings and ruchings in muslin or
net, with a bow of ribbon and a bunch of feathers on the crown, whence
fell the curtain at the back to the neck. The poke gradually decreased
in height and width, eventually assuming a semicircle as close to the
brow as the bonnet of a barge-woman, and the French ladies adopted
this fashion, making the bonnets of straw and draping them with a
green gauze veil. About 1860 the crinoline of horsehair and steels
"swelled visibly," like another hero, and Leghorn hats took the place
of bonnets. These, decked with ribbons and plumes, would bend low their
brims over the face of beauty and ugliness.</p>

<p>Hair was permitted every license except the monstrous unhealthy
misdemeanours of the Stuart and Tudor periods. In turn, it strained
itself rigidly to the topmost point of the crown, where, coiled in
plaits, it met the just reward of a disfiguring bunch of feathers; it
puffed itself out in a mass behind the ears, or banded itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
demurely over them. It merrily shook itself in ringlets from a centre
parting, which knew such sorrow as Macassar oil and the controlling
influence of the side comb; or, stuffed out with frisettes, it hid its
insincerity in the meshes of the silk and chenille net; or it lay low
in flat curls at the nape of the neck. At different times it placed the
burden of its rolls and curls upon every inch of the crown&mdash;on
top of it, in the middle of it, behind it, and in front of it, where,
indeed, it once developed a frenzy of disorder, and hung in wild and
fringed confusion to the eyebrow.</p>

<p>This reminds me to note the royal conservatism of her gracious
Majesty Queen Alexandra, who follows fashion at a dignified distance,
lending her sweet personal enchantment to our view of her antedated
coiffure, with its raised curls over her brow pointing slightly to the
centre of the forehead. Royalty no longer seeks to lead fashions, nor,
indeed, to follow them, the only exceptions to the rule of generality
being the royal ladies of the houses of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and of
Connaught,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
who all show a most delightful appreciation of, and a becoming sympathy
with, every vagary of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Mode</i>. Yet our supreme Royalty takes
interest in the national aspect of the affairs of costume, and bestows
much personal trouble in arousing loyalty towards Irish poplins,
British-made silks, the tweed industries of Ireland and Scotland
and Wales, and the lace manufactures of Devonshire and Bucks and
Nottingham.</p>

<p>In costume the Victorian era was "Everything-arian," welcoming and
discarding all shapes and styles of garments, and gathering in the
fashions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
from every age, adopting with mild enthusiasm and moderated transport
the most graceful and the most graceless, and impartially bestowing
attention upon the slashed and puffed sleeves of the Tudors, the lace
collar and wide ruff of the Stuarts, the Watteau dress, re-christened
"Dolly Varden," the short waists of the Empire, the full coats and
large revers of the Directoire, and the long plumes and brilliant
buckles of the seventeenth century. An injustice to the word √¶sthetic
was committed by the followers of a fashion which cried aloud for sad
colours, sadder shapes, and the saddest untidiness; and amongst the
ridiculous mistakes may be written down a polonaise dress looping up in
unexpected places, flounced and furbelowed without bounds of reason,
while extending itself from the waist over an immense bustle. There is
satisfaction in remembering the reaction which took place after this
in favour of the eelskin dress, setting as tightly as was convenient
from neck to heel, when the woven jersey-bodice had a short spell of
patronage, but, proving itself suavely unsympathetic in its treatment
of any but the perfect figure, lapsed speedily into disuse. About 1882
the questionable charms of the bustle reasserted themselves, and the
Watteau style of frock exercised some beneficial influence over the
waist of its fair wearer.</p>

<p>Man's last aspiration towards dandyism gasped and died in the
embrace of the stock of Count D'Orsay. Now, woman alone rules the roost
of fashion, man is "no longer dressed but clothed," and under feminine
autocracy, dress, whose interests are widely and publicly recognised,
has reached a position of primary importance. No more are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
these interests represented in an unwanted corner of a monthly
periodical, or in the letters of the town cousin to the country cousin,
or in the counsels of perfection signed by "the old woman." They
maintain various journals established in their honour, and in the field
of Fashion England has risen from the ranks to leadership; while a
wide plain of cheap selection opens to the proletariat the chance to
beautify their outer as well as their under wear, which has emerged
from the uncompromising confines of stiff long-cloth and Madeira work
to the seductive limits encompassed by fine lawn and embroidery, allied
to Valenciennes lace and soft ribbon.</p>

<p>As I write, Fashion seems a pleasantly moderate thing, and the
summer-day dress of white linen, with a broad-brimmed hat encircled
by the floating veil, and the evening dress of chiffon garlanded
with chiffon, appear to justify my suspicion that "whatever is, is
right, in the world of dress." And, when I remember that the "picture"
dress of to-day was the garb of convention yesterday, I can hope that
our bespangled nets and tinselled brocades will in due course be
encircled with charm from the halo of the bygone. May it also, I pray,
come to soften the hardest outline of our leather-trimmed tweed and
serge costumes of sport, and to exercise a benign influence upon our
disproportionate figures and our perky toques!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="p5">OF BRITISH PEASANTS</p>


<p>While searching in the annals of the bygone costume of the peasant,
the most democratic person might be tempted to regret the repealing of
all sumptuary law. We are grateful to-day to recognise the artistic
value of the red tie of the masculine tiller of the field, or of the
coloured handkerchief over the head of the harvest-woman, but, in those
other times, the plains and the fields, the woods and the forests,
were the background for a people in brave array, on which blue, red,
green, and white played conspicuous part. And not alone in colour
must their garb have been pre-eminently attractive to the eye, but in
the simplicity of its make, the liberal display of white linen about
the neck and the head, and the further addition of coloured lacings.
These completed an effect of picturesque carelessness which may well
have been allowed to cover a multitude of sins of omission in personal
cleanliness.</p>

<p>Glancing roughly through the periods, I find that the dress most
worn in England by the peasant women in the eleventh century consisted
of a coarse woollen gown with long sleeves closely fitting to the
wrists, a white linen apron, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
linen kerchief covering the head as a wimple. In the reign of Henry I.
it is recorded that men wore simple tunics of red lined with white,
innocent of a girdle, and open from the waist at the left side, the
sleeves possessing long cuffs reaching almost to the elbow. The mantle
was often added, and beneath the tunic were chauss√©s or drawers, and
either boots or shoes, with crossed diagonal lacings. Hats or hoods
were of leather, felt, or cloth, and warm mitten-shaped gloves of
coarse make were adopted. In the time of Henry II. women, who held
faithfully to linen aprons, caps, and kerchiefs, wore long gowns and
plain bodices laced up the back, the sleeves put rather full at the
shoulders, and the petticoats pleated at the waist.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth century the bliaus, or smock, of canvas or fustian
was made in many varieties of coarse cloth, russet, and cordetum
produced for the use of the poor. The peasant women were converted
towards some ambition for the beautiful, and their costume became
impressed with the ornamental, consisting of a bodice cut low in the
neck to show a pleated chemisette of white linen, and attached to a
fully gathered skirt, fastening with buttons down the front. Their
boots were high and had buttons on the fronts, while the white linen
apron and white linen cap or kerchief still held their place.</p>

<p>In the days of King Edward II. the men adopted a long gown buttoning
from the neck to the waist, with loosely hanging sleeves, showing
closely-fitting under-sleeves, the hood being folded back or pendent,
and the shoes pointed.</p>

<p>The double dress was introduced in the fourteenth century, a dress
which is in the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
which we now associate with the fishwife's dress, the upper skirt being
pinned back over a full petticoat, the bodice of this being laced and
the sleeves loose. Chaucer describes his poor Ploughman as wearing a
tabard&mdash;a garment unheard of before the fourteenth century&mdash;a
hat, scrip, and scarf; the Shipmanne was garbed "all in a gown of
falding to the knee." This material was a kind of frieze, and in this
day the coarse red woollen material still used by the Irish peasant
women for petticoats and jackets is the old falding.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the chemisette to some extent yielded place
to the bodice high at the neck and fastened at the back, finished by a
small linen kerchief tied in the front. A plain full woollen petticoat
was in vogue, and the sleeves were turned back with pleated cuffs, the
option in headgear being allowed between a close hood or kerchief and a
plain hat of straw.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward IV. the peasant women reverted most wisely to
the bodice, which was cut low at the neck in a circular form; the plain
skirts were gathered at the waist, and over a white linen cap they
placed a hood and cape cut in one piece.</p>

<p>In the days when the greatest widower was achieving his conjugal
record, an old country-man is described as wearing a "buttoned cap"
(one with flaps over the ears, turned up and fastened with a button),
a "lockram falling band, a narrow turned-down collar of coarse
linen&mdash;coarse but clean, a russet-coat; a white belt of horse
hide, right horse collar white leather; a close round breech of russet
sheep's-wool, with a long stock of white kersey, and a high shoe with
yellow buckles." A pretty fellow, I'm convinced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>In this reign, too, ornamental braid found its place on the
costumes of the peasant women, whose bodices, cut square and edged
with braid, were laced up at the back. However, novelty, which is ever
desirable, was obtained by limiting the bodices, raising the waists,
and tightening the full sleeves at the wrists, where they were finished
with a small frill.</p>

<p>Braid later gained further patronage, and in the reign of Mary was
allowed the privilege of ornamenting the full petticoats, when the
closely-fitting bodices were still laced in V-shape and flaunted an
upstanding collar of Medici tendency cut in one with revers. On the
top of the sleeves was a padded roll, and upon the head a quaint cap
displayed a small point in front, and bore a close resemblance in the
crown to the penny bun.</p>

<p>The early Elizabethan peasant woman's dress consisted of a double
skirt, the under one of serge, full, the upper one with braid round the
hem, made in a contrasting shade, and folded back to form a panier. The
tight-fitting bodice had a pointed plastron edged with ribbon on either
side, and the bodice was bound at the hem with ribbon, which tied in
a bow at the waist, a larger bow appearing at the bust, while round
the neck a gauffered frill outspread itself with stiff importance. The
sleeves were full, and the head was covered with a lawn cap, the crown
of which was full, and the curtain, turning back in front, was trimmed
with lace. Yet another style of dress worn at this period had a full
skirt braided round the hem and an upper skirt with a wider braid, the
square-cut bodice, also braided, being finished with a turned-down
linen collar. The sleeves displayed double puffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to the elbow, thence fitting tightly to the wrist, and braid again
appeared on the mob-cap of lawn, and on the hem of the lawn apron.</p>

<p>This might have been the attire of many a wilful wench hieing forth
on her holiday, in the hopes of catching a glimpse of some green-clad
figure in the wake of gay Robin Hood.</p>

<p>Pleasant reading is of the milkmaid of the reign of James I.; she
must have been a bonny figure in her box-pleated under-skirt of red
serge, with a blue serge over-skirt tucked up on the hips. Her tight
bodice was of blue and laced down the front, her sleeves were long
and loose to allow of their being rolled back to the elbow, round her
neck was wound a bright-coloured kerchief, and on her head another,
while, for merrymaking and f√™tes, she would tie her apron with coloured
ribbons, and let bunches of ribbon adorn her smart high-heeled shoes.
As an alternative to the kerchief she would wear over her hood a plain
straw hat with a slightly turned-up brim decked with ribbons.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth brought with it austerity of dress; sad tones of
dull brown and grey receiving popular patronage, while the formal linen
cuffs, collar, and cap were ubiquitous. A plain material formed the
over-skirt of many a dress which bore a striped under-skirt, tight
sleeves, and a plain, tightly-fitting bodice. Cuffs and collars grew
wider, the linen apron had two pockets, and there was added to costume
a circular cape of dull serge. The high felt hat was adorned simply by
a plain band of ribbon.</p>

<p>During the Restoration, colour asserted itself once more, and dress
was again pretty, a commend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>able
example having a blue linen skirt with a band of fancy material round
the hem, a full basque, and a linen collar, the front adorned with
braid, the apron striped.</p>

<p>Stripes were quite a feature of fashion then and in the later days
of William III., when the striped skirt would be adorned with a deep
band of plain material trimmed with braid, the striped bodice cut
V-shaped to show a vest of pleated linen, the sleeves being plain with
linen cuffs, the apron of linen, and the cloth hood and cape cut in one
piece.</p>

<p>Fancy materials were made in the reign of Anne, when short skirts
frequently were composed of stripes beneath a plain over-skirt bunched
on the hips. The bodice then came out in the glory of a muslin fichu,
and the long sleeves were turned back to the elbow, the cap was of
muslin too, with a full crown and gauffered edge. A charming picture of
a country-woman of 1711 shows her wearing a tucked-up gown with short
loose sleeves, a pair of stiff stays, and an apron, with high-heeled
shoes and a low cap turned up in front. Caps yielded place to hats for
the lower orders in the eighteenth century, when plain flat straw hats
became the only wear, being recognised as serving a useful purpose in
the carrying of fruit and fish.</p>

<p>Cretonne first enjoyed a share of recognition in the reign of George
I., when the under-skirts were made of this in stripes, gathered at the
waist, and over these was worn a serge skirt tucked up at the hips. The
tight-fitting bodice was of serge laced in front, cut low in the neck,
and outlined with a loosely-knotted handkerchief, the full sleeves
being turned back below the elbows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>In glancing through the records, I find in the reign of George II.
but little change from this state of affairs. The bodice was laced over
a white linen chemisette, and finished with a deep collar and tight
sleeves with frills of muslin at the elbow, the apron with its two
pockets being ornamented with a deep band of embroidered muslin. The
hair, however, received more attention, being tied round with a ribbon
under a muslin cap, while a straw hat was worn over it when the fair
maids took their walks abroad.</p>

<p>The modish mandate was reversed in the following reign, when the
under-skirt was of serge with the over-skirt of chintz gathered on to
the bodice, which was full at the back and opened in the front, the
bodice being further adorned by lacings over a velvet vest, cut low,
with a muslin fichu to put the finishing touch and white muslin frills
appearing to adorn the tight sleeves. The apron of muslin had a large
pocket on the right side, and the straw hat was invariably trimmed with
a bow of ribbon, also placed on the right side.</p>

<p>When George IV. was king the full skirt was gathered on to the short
bodice all round beneath a band of ribbon, which finished at the back
to conceal the fact. The muslin fichu was generally adopted, padded
rolls were on the shoulders, the white linen apron was long, and the
head bowed itself to the fascinations of the bonnet of drawn white
cambric.</p>

<p>A full woollen skirt, gathered round the waist, was the popular
costume in the time of William IV., when the tight bodice buttoned down
the front, a triple cape attached to a band of ribbon and fastened in
the front was thrown over the shoulders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ribbon proved itself as serviceable as becoming over the crown of the
straw hat, where it was placed to secure it firmly to its wearer.</p>

<p>My investigations by the way of Scotch and Irish and Welsh peasants
have been few, but the details of one modern representative Irish
peasant's dress I can quote as including "a short skirt of linsey
turned up over a petticoat of red or some other bright colour, with
the bodice belted round the waist and laced down the front, worn
beneath a long frieze cloak with cap and hood; the head is covered
with a kerchief." Of imperishable memory is the red Connemara colleen
cloak; and the native Welsh dress is not less dear to the lovers of the
picturesque, with its high pointed hat worn above a frilled lawn cap,
the worsted shawl, the short petticoat, and white apron and trim shoes.
The Highland dress was in its original form a chequered covering known
as a breconfeile, a plain piece of tartan two yards wide and six yards
in length placed round the waist in folds, and held in position by a
leather belt. The plaid was fastened on the left shoulder by a large
brooch, the right end hanging down longer than the left, being tucked
into the belt, while the right arm was left uncovered save in the
severest weather, when the plaid was thrown over the whole body. This
was the wear, until the end of the eighteenth century, of Lowlanders
and Highlanders alike.</p>

<p>The Scotch, and the Irish too, had a rooted antipathy to foot-gear,
preferring to carry their shoes and stockings rather than permit them
to do their proper duties, and when the etiquette of church-going
demanded the sacrifice of this inclination, they yielded only during
the service, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sitting on any convenient gravestone to remove the unwelcome
impediments.</p>

<p>The national head-dress of the Highlanders is the round flat bonnet
of blue cloth, with an eagle's feather; and for many centuries men and
women wore plaids alike, the usual colours being white striped with
red, black, or blue, the men's stockings matching these.</p>

<p>Thinking seriously over the dress of the peasant in the North,
South, East, and West, I am tempted to protest that progression has
meant retrogression, and that the modern country-woman, with her
indiscreet lace-trimmed blouse revealing the ragged belt of her
mud-coloured petticoat, makes a sorry figure in comparison with
her sister-toiler of the past; and I recall sorrowfully even this
description of an early Victorian peasant-woman's dress which reads:
"To consist of a full skirt of print gathered into a band at the waist;
there is a full crossover-bodice over a full vest of the same material,
finished with a frill at the neck. The sleeves are full above the elbow
with two puffs, and from these are tight to the wrists, and a muslin
mob-cap is worn with a bow of ribbon in front."</p>

<p>The country-woman who dwells in the indulgent times of Edward VII.
should ponder over the picture, and repent of her shapeless bodice
divorced from her unsympathetic skirt, and her cloth cricket cap held
by aggressive pins above a group of tortured wisps of hair bound in
steel bondage to a cruel curler.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="p5">OF SOME FOREIGN PEASANTS</p>


<p>I regret, from the practical as well as the artistic point of view,
the threatened disappearance of local colouring, as emphasised by the
characteristic costume of the people, for I am convinced that the
adoption of a uniform style of dress by a community greatly furthers
the cause of neatness and economy.</p>

<p>No opportunity being afforded for the display of personal bad taste,
extravagance is discouraged, and the spick and span are virtues which
may distinguish the careful from the slatternly, and reveal much to
the student of character. A love of colour and personal adornment
is inherent in the human race, and it is to be regretted that the
relentless advance of commerce is responsible for the blotting out of a
country's individuality, and reducing all places to the same dead level
of monotony.</p>

<p>Differing slightly but distinctly with the locality, the dress of
the peasants of Brittany is second in interest to none in Europe. This
fact, coupled with an instinctive conservatism common to those who "go
down to the sea in ships," is, no doubt, accountable for the tenacity
with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the Bretons cling to their national costume, bearing it with them when
they emigrate and donning it on gala occasions in the new land.</p>

<p>Peculiar to the peasant of Bignon is a white flannel petticoat, the
hem surmounted by a scarlet band. Pleated at the waist, it joins a
bodice fashioned from bright red cloth, which fits closely up to the
throat and is edged with black velvet embroidered in various coloured
worsteds, turned-back cuffs to match finishing the tight elbow-sleeves;
while the apron, in a dark tone of mulberry, fastens by means of a sash
tied in a bow at the side. Covering the head is a small cap of white
linen, which serves as foundation for a conical erection contrived from
a coarse starched texture resembling brown holland. To this is attached
a pair of long flaps, which can be pinned up or left hanging according
to the taste of the wearer. The well-to-do possess a necklace of amber
and black beads, and a gold and ebony crucifix suspended from a narrow
black velvet ribbon.</p>

<p>If dress be an outward and visible sign of character, then should
the people of Quimper be the gayest of the gay. The costume of
the district consists of a laced jacket with tight elbow-sleeves,
supplemented by full white ones which reach to the wrist, and a short
petticoat of ample proportions. Blue is a favourite shade for both
corsage and skirt, which are frequently glorified by the addition of
red and gold lace. Blue and pink inspire the sleeves, the under ones
being of white, tied, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au poignet</i>, with yellow ribbon. The chemisette
displays a multi-coloured collar, and the apron is in a vivid tone of
orange.</p>

<p>The Morbihan department is distinguished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a variety of head-dresses, some of which are exceedingly high, while
all fit closely round the face, and many display pendent lappets
behind.</p>

<p>Odd, but by no means unbecoming, is the costume of the Normandy
peasant. The skirt is of striped woollen material, partially concealed
beneath a red and blue apron. Of black, white, red, or maroon worsted,
the bodice boasts long sleeves, some of which are scarlet in colour
from wrist to elbow and dull claret to the shoulder, a small fringed
shawl hiding the upper portion of the arm. Quite the most striking and
important feature is the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgoin</i>. Evolved from stiff white muslin
drawn over a cardboard shape, it is very high in the crown, the wide
brim narrowing towards the back, whence dangle two lace streamers.
The hair is turned up in a manner best described as clubbed, the ends
disappearing beneath the cap, while on f√™te-days the head-dress is
composed of the very finest muslin, elaborately trimmed with lace, and
fastened by means of a velvet strap passed under the chin or across the
forehead.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bourgoin</i> is encountered in its most ornate form, however, in
the Pays de Caux, where it is reverently regarded as an heirloom and
handed down from generation to generation. Wonderfully and fearfully
made, the upper portion is of light blue pasteboard strewn with gold
tinsel flowers, and ruffled with muslin bordered with lace. The brim is
of scarlet velvet, lappets floating behind, and a chin-strap holding
it in place. Unlike the women of Brittany, who carefully conceal all
traces of hair, the Normandy peasant arranges hers in coquettish curls
on the temples.</p>

<p>Despite their long and romantic association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with the country, and the impress they left on its architecture and
its history, the influence of the Moors is in nowise apparent in the
dress of the Spanish peasantry. The people of the Peninsula manage
to unite in admirable fashion the practical with the picturesque, as
expressed by the costumes peculiar to the different provinces. What,
for instance, could be more happily conceived than the dress of a
Castilian peasant? The short sleeveless coat, or bolero, consists
of coloured cotton edged with an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">appliqu√©</i> design in imitation of
coarse braid. This is worn in conjunction with a shirt of white
cotton conspicuous for a stand-up collar and sleeves to the elbow, a
wide red sash encircling the waist, where it is held firmly in place
by a narrow leather belt on which the wearer's name, or that of his
fianc√©e, is embroidered. The tight knickerbockers are of serviceable
texture, gartered at the knee, each showing four silver or gilt buttons
in a row up the outside of the leg. The gaiters combine the duty of
stockings, and are supplemented by low, thick-soled sandals, termed
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">alpargat&#257;s</i> or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esparde√±as</i>, tied round the ankle with gay
ribbons. The f√™te costume of the women embraces a voluminous skirt of
fine cloth, extending below the knees and trimmed about the bottom with
wide and narrow bands of black ribbon velvet, and an apron, likewise
of cloth, but in a contrasting colour, bordered with gold lace or
passementerie. The closely-fitting jacket reaches to the hips; the
seams are outlined in gold lace, and the sleeves slashed open from
the elbow to the wrist to reveal white under-sleeves belonging to the
chemisette, a second glimpse of which is caught at the neck in front.
An immensely long coral chain is wound countless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
times about the throat, and dangling from it are sacred medallions and
variously sized crosses, the whole forming a plastron which descends to
the waist. White cotton stockings are usual&mdash;red ones indicating
a bride&mdash;and black leather shoes relieved with ribbon rosettes.
The hair is plaited, tied with black velvet, and allowed to hang down
behind, and the mitre-shaped hat is of black velvet trimmed up each
side with a serried row of silver buttons.</p>

<p>In Valencia the peasantry of both sexes affect sandals laced up the
leg. The women wear a short, brightly coloured skirt and an apron, the
lower portion of which is in one shade and the upper in another, the
latter being brilliantly embroidered. The tight bodice laces in front
across a white chemisette, and displays long, closely-fitting sleeves,
while the head is enclosed in a white bonnet which forms a frill round
the neck, and is surmounted by a hat with a shallow crown, and a brim
shaped like an inverted saucer. The dress of the men is correspondingly
simple, comprising a light-blue linen waistcoat buttoned up to the
chin, where it is finished with a white collar, a sash, and a short
open coat, remarkable for buttons down both sides. The trousers
terminate at the calf, and a red handkerchief is wound round the
head.</p>

<p>In the mountain fastnesses of Catalonia, the women wear, in lieu
of a bonnet, a white veil, which falls to the waist behind, and
a crossover fichu fashioned of cotton, and chiefly notable for a
decorative border in a contrasting shade. Little is seen of the bodice
beyond the tight sleeves, which finish at the wrist with a band of black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
velvet and a silver buckle, and the ankle-length skirt is almost
concealed by a full round apron. All the jewellery common to the
district is exceptionally massive and set with red or green stones, the
pendent ear-rings of gold or silver being so heavy that they have to be
supported by cords, lest they should tear the flesh.</p>

<p>A male peasant belonging to the same locality dons a short open
coat of light-blue velvet, long-sleeved and boasting diminutive revers
and silver buttons. The white cotton shirt introduces a turned-down
collar and a gaily-coloured cravat, tied in a sailor's knot and drawn
through a silver ring, and the waistcoat consists of striped red and
white calico, while a scarlet sash supports tight knickerbockers of
blue velvet. These are met by leggings of tan leather, the low shoes
being attached by means of thongs, after the style of sandals. Shaped
somewhat like a fool's cap, the peak of the scarlet head-dress is
rolled over in front to form a wide flap immediately above the brows,
a last touch being given by a striped red and yellow scarf thrown over
the left shoulder, the ends edged with deep fringe and pendent balls.
For the mayor, or that important local dignitary the driver of the
diligence, the back of the coat is embroidered with a pot of flowers
in florid tints, while another badge of office, pertaining to the same
functionaries, is a patch of scarlet or green cloth on either elbow.</p>

<p>A peasant woman of Asturias, is distinguished by a full skirt
below the knees, and a short narrow apron of black velvet traced
with a checked design in silver braid. A joyously-patterned cotton
handkerchief is arranged on the head, and tied in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
butterfly bow in front, and the tight bodice boasts closely-fitting
sleeves, turned back with black velvet cuffs embroidered in a variety
of brilliant shades, a small fringed shawl crossing at the bust and
tying at the waist behind. White thread stockings and black shoes
complete the picture.</p>

<p>The mere mention of the word Switzerland is sufficient to conjure
up a medley of conflicting emotions. Thoughts of Nestl√©'s milk,
Peter's chocolate, Cook's parties, and picture post-cards adorned
with edelweiss, struggle to obliterate memories of majestic mountains
whose hoary peaks pierce the calm blue of a cloudless sky, of sunsets
of awful beauty, and of sunrises which flood the cold white Alps with
roseate light, changing the silver of the lakes to burnished gold.
Homelier visions arise of wooden chalets daintily perched high on the
mountain side, or low in the valley, of milk and honey, white butter
and black bread, and of fair-haired waitresses in national costume.</p>

<p>Each canton has its distinctive dress.</p>

<p>The peasant women of Lucerne wear large flat hats of smooth straw,
the crown encircled by bows of ribbon interrupted by a bunch of
flowers. The tri-coloured skirt barely covers the knee, where it is
met by white stockings, and the corselet displays lace, embroidery,
and brass or silver buttons. The white chemisette vaunts full short
sleeves, and fits up to the throat, where it is occasionally finished
with a broad frill, while the hair is drawn off the forehead and hangs
down the back in two plaits.</p>

<p>In Solerne the dress of the feminine portion
of the community includes a white petticoat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
edged with pink, which just shows beneath a black skirt embroidered
with red, while round the neck is knotted a black silk kerchief, the
bodice being red and green and the chemisette of white muslin with wide
sleeves to the elbow. Snowy muslin inspires the large cap with its
gauffered frill, other details being white stockings, ribbon garters,
and black shoes laced with scarlet.</p>

<p>Possibly the prettiest costume of all is to be found in the Canton
of St. Gall. On Sundays and f√™te-days it comprises a small white
muslin cap, lined with green silk and displaying a crimson crown. The
hair is drawn into a single plait at the back of the head, fastened
with long gold or silver pins. The snowy chemisette finishes with a
moderately-sized ruffle at the throat, and disappears into a velvet
stomacher, the little open jacket bearing a border of coloured
ribbons.</p>

<p>Quite the most gaudy dress is that characteristic of Grison. The
bodice is of bright orange, laced with green ribbon over a blue
stomacher, and the skirt is in a penetrating tone of violet hemmed with
green, in brilliant contrast to red stockings worked with white clocks.
The effect is happily modified by a black lace cap, which forms a point
on the forehead and is tied under the chin.</p>

<p>To those in quest of the eminently becoming, the costume of the
women of Unterwalden commends itself. The hair is parted in front,
and hangs down behind in two plaits joined by a species of slide in
silver. The short full skirt is evolved from coarse brown material, the
stockings are blue and the shoes black, with metal heels and ribbon
bows. The apron is provided with a scarlet bib, and the sleeveless
corsage is filled in with a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
chemisette, with puffed elbow-sleeves terminating in black velvet bands
and frills of lace. About the neck is a deep filigree silver collar,
from which hang two enormous silver pendants, one resting on the bust
at either side.</p>

<p>The typical Roman peasant woman makes a picturesque figure in a
skirt of some dark material and an apron brightly trimmed with two
broadish bands of embroidery, one appearing immediately below the hips
and the other at the knees. The tight, sleeveless corsage laces behind,
and is supported by narrow shoulder-straps, while the white chemisette
has long sleeves and is low at the throat. Ordinarily the hair is
allowed to hang loosely beneath a head-dress fashioned from a length of
snowy linen, folded in such a way as to form a narrow strip, which is
pinned at the temples and flung back to hang down behind. All but the
very poorest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wear necklaces, pendent ear-rings, chains and crosses.</p>

<p>The costume of the Trastaverini, although they
are inhabitants of the same city, differs somewhat
from that of the Romans. The women plait their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hair, decorate it with silver bodkins, and confine it in a silk net.
On gala days they don velvet bodices laced with gold, and silk skirts,
which may be white to match the chemisette, or coloured, an essential
accessory being a scarlet apron. The men also wear silk nets, their
jackets being of black velvet enlivened by red silk sashes, while their
black shoes vaunt large silver buckles.</p>

<p>In some of the Pontifical States there is striking resemblance
between the dress common to the district and that associated with the
Irish peasantry. The women tie kerchiefs on their heads in the same way
as their Hibernian sisters, a second point of similarity existing in
the hooded cloaks.</p>

<p>Strangely incongruous though it seems, when taken in conjunction
with their sunny clime and joyous levity of temperament, the peasantry
of Florence exhibit a marked predilection for black. On f√™te-days the
Tuscans don a tiny hat cocked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
an acute angle over the left ear, the hair at the other side being
profusely decorated with pearls or an ornamental comb. They also
display a pretty taste in jewellery, wearing pearl ear-rings and
pearl and coral necklaces, other articles of attire including black
velvet slippers, and sleeveless bodices laced with ribbon over a white
chemisette. Occasionally the hair is turned up in a knot beneath a veil
which hangs down behind, but, when working or going to market, the
women imprison it in a silken mesh adorned with tassels, the latter
being sometimes of gold and silver.</p>

<p>The Bolognese peasant women continue faithful to the tradition of
the <em>zendada</em>, a veil falling from the plaited hair and draped over the
shoulders in graceful fashion. Coral is greatly in demand for purposes
of adornment, and combs and pins are liberally employed to decorate the
hair.</p>

<p>So intense is her love for finery, that in Lombardy it is a
common occurrence for a peasant woman to spend all her earnings upon
jewellery, going barefoot the while. Another weakness of hers takes
the direction of large German fans in black and gold. These are much
in evidence at all festivities in Turin. Bright colours are preferred
to sombre ones, and it is easy to distinguish girls from married
women, as the latter have square linen veils, while the former allow
their hair to be seen, braiding it, and fastening it with a comb or
formidable-looking pin.</p>

<p>Economical and self-denying though she may be in other respects, the
peasant woman of Genoa is recklessly extravagant the moment it is a
question of jewellery. To what lengths her passion for display carries
her may be gauged from the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that when she is going to be married she thinks nothing of paying seven
or eight hundred francs for a necklace.</p>

<p>Not only are the Croatian women noted for their unusual beauty of
face and form, they are equally famous for their industry, and the
national costume is a marvel of needlework. The example illustrated on
page 124 shows embroidery playing its part on the sleeves, the full
skirt, and the bodice. The chemisette is of white lawn, and jewels are
around the neck, and flowers wreathe the head over a lawn cap which
conceals the hair.</p>

<p>The sketch of the Croatian man on page 125 shows him in a hat of
black felt, a coat of white bordered with blue, and a cape lined with
red, edged with a pattern formed by an application of red cloth.</p>

<p>A more elaborate edition of this dress permits a gold fringe on the
low crown of the hat, and a red fringe on a deep leather pouch which is
held on the left hip by a leather strap.</p>

<p>Departing from the classical severity of palla and peplum, the dress
of modern Greece has nothing in common with that of a people who scaled
the heights of immortality in the simplest of garbs. Peasant women
wear spangled petticoats of blue or pink silk, a long-waisted costume
of purple velvet embroidered in gold, high-heeled shoes which display
silver buckles, and a kerchief draped on the plaited hair.</p>

<p>The men resemble the typical stage brigand, in a double-breasted
waistcoat of blue or maroon velvet edged with gold lace, a row of gold
or silver buttons running from either shoulder to meet at the waist,
which is encircled by a brilliantly coloured sash.</p>

<p>A distinguishing note is given by the thoraki, a characteristic
garment of blue cotton, suggesting in form a stiff sack wider at the
bottom than the top, with holes at the corners for the legs to pass
through. A substitute for this is a white petticoat to the knees, and
other accessories are white stockings and black shoes with large silver
buckles.</p>

<p>Some resemblance to the costume of ancient Greece may be traced in
the dress of the shepherds, who wear cloaks of sheep's wool or goat's
hair, with bare feet encased in sandals of untanned leather strapped
across the instep and up the lower portion of the leg. Thus attired,
might the Pyrrhian have climbed those mountains which looked on
Marathon, as Marathon looked on the sea.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="p5">OF SOME FOREIGN PEASANTS (<i>continued</i>)</p>


<p>In Russia the convention of dress may not serve as an index to the
mind of the country, for the peasant is allowed to share with the
prince a fancy for gold, coloured embroidery, and silk and jewels, and
it has not yet become necessary for the Duma to include an advocate in
the cause of costume.</p>

<p>The history of Russia is inscribed upon the dress of its people.
Travelling from north to south and from east to west, the costumes
of the peasantry everywhere bear the impress of the political
vicissitudes through which the particular locality has passed. This,
coupled with the fact that no empire in the world is made up of such
an agglomeration of vastly different races, accounts for the immense
diversity of styles.</p>

<p>To gain some idea of the ingredients which go to make up the
sartorial <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pot-pourri</i>, one has but to pay a visit to the great annual
fair at Nijni Novgorod. There Cossack rubs shoulders with Finn, Jew
with Laplander, Tartar with Slav, Persian, Siberian, Bulgarian, and
Circassian adding to the interest of the scene and the Babel of
tongues. As everything Russian leads up to the one forbidden, and
therefore burning, question, politics, it is impossible even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
treat of the national costume without touching lightly upon those
crises which determined the ultimate cut of a sleeve or the shape of a
head-dress.</p>

<p>Long ago Byzantium imposed its religion and its fashions upon its
great northern neighbour. Both were readily adopted by Russia, and a
significant side-light is thrown upon the national character by the
fact that when, in the thirteenth century, the Mongolian invasion
reversed the political situation, the vanquished adopted the dress of
their conquerors, but not their faith. This is strictly true of all
but the sovereigns, whose costume remained more or less faithful to
tradition, and never entirely departed from the Byzantium original.</p>

<p>Although Byzantium dictated the fashions of the classes, the masses
were unaffected thereby, and the costumes of the serfs trace their
source to Slav and Tartar, according to the district.</p>

<p>The first things to impress the foreigner are the gorgeous nature
of the f√™te dresses worn by the women, and the lavish use of gold
trimming. This love of gold, as applied to decorative purposes, would
appear inherent in the Russian character, revealing itself in the
heavy gilding on the icons and the many glittering domes of Moscow and
St. Petersburg. More suggestive of a fairy princess than of a peasant
is the gala toilet of the female population of Tver. Contrived from
thick silk shot with gold, the wide round skirt is pleated behind, the
opening down the front and the hem bordered with gold, while the white
chemisette vaunts puffed elbow-sleeves finished with frills, three rows
of pearls encircling the collarless neck. In summer time the little
sarafan, or, for want of a better term, jacket, is made without sleeves
and resembles a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
short full petticoat that sticks out, as though stiffened, at the
bottom. It, too, is of brightly coloured silk, and descends from the
armpits to below the hips, being supported by gold shoulder-straps, an
edging of gold galon running round the bottom and up the fronts. The
head-dress consists of a species of gilt diadem set with artificial
gems in coloured glass. This encircles the base of an erection of
stiffened calico, reminiscent in shape of the glass shades designed
to protect those floral atrocities in Berlin-wool and wax that were
so dear to the heart of the early Victorian housewife. Concealing the
structure is a voluminous veil of white silk or gauze, striped or
strewn with flowers, and invariably bordered with gold. The duty of
gloves is performed by casings of velvet and sable, which cover the
back of the hand and enclose the finger-tips, while leaving the palm
and thumb free.</p>

<p>Still more beautiful and sumptuous is the f√™te dress of the women
of Torjok. They wear a singular head-dress known as <em>kokoschink</em>,
which, literally translated, signifies the crest of a hen, the why and
wherefore of the name being a riddle beyond the power of the average
intelligence to solve. Modelled on the lines of a reversed funnel, the
tall slender crown of the <em>kokoschink</em> is white, encircled by narrow
bands of gold, and surmounted in the case of married women by a metal
ornament which may be triangular, oval, round, or crescent-shaped.
The only rule from which no departure may be made is that the crown
be absolutely vertical, whereas the crown common to the spinster of
the community slants abruptly towards the front. All without exception
display a brim composed of an outstanding frill of white lace encrusted
with seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
pearls, and an enormous veil of white gauze embroidered and edged with
gold, which is attached to the top of the <em>kokoschink</em> and floats over
the shoulders, the two points dipping to touch the ground at either
side.</p>

<p>These veils are not, as might easily be supposed, of Mohammedan
origin, nor are they even remotely associated with romance. As a matter
of fact, nothing could well be more prosaic than their history, for
they were first adopted as a protection against the plague of flies
with which the district is infested in warm weather.</p>

<p>Pre-eminently picturesque, the costume they shroud reveals a skirt
of such generous proportions as to recall memories of the crinoline.
This is of silk, and buttons down the front, and it is not only edged
with gold, but bears an all-over pattern traced in gold galon. The
loose sleeveless jacket terminates below the waist, where it stands
out stiffly, and is of similar texture, treated in equally lavish
style with gold, the huge leg-o'-mutton sleeves belonging to the
white chemisette being richly embroidered in gold thread. The throat
is hidden by an unyielding cravat of white taffetas ruled with fine
gold cord, the short ends crossed under the chin; and the shoes are of
morocco or velvet, with a design worked in gold threads.</p>

<p>In winter the veil is abandoned in favour of a shawl of white
taffetas fringed with gold, worn over a modified version of the summer
<em>kokoschink</em>, in pale blue silk, embroidered with seed pearls and gold.
The all-enveloping greatcoat is of cloth or velvet, edged with fur, and
lapped well over on the right side, where it fastens near the shoulder
only. A feature of the wrap is the sleeve, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is narrow and of abnormal length, terminating below the knees in a fur
cuff, no hint being allowed to transpire of the hands thus jealously
guarded from the unwelcome attentions of frost.</p>

<p>The peasant woman of Riazan wears black shoes, white stockings
rucked at the ankles, a shortish skirt of bright blue cotton, and
a fringed apron worked in a variety of colours, notably yellow and
scarlet. The chief garment is the ponka, a loose round coat to the
knees, very like that of a Chinaman, fashioned from white linen edged
with a narrow border of red, the wide elbow-sleeves terminating in
an inch-deep band of the same. Open in front, the jacket allows a
liberal view of a red blouse, worked in a characteristic cross-stitch
design in brilliant shades, the long "bishop" sleeves being of plain
Turkey-red, finished with shallow frills hemmed with blue in a tone
corresponding to that of the skirt. Almost impossible to describe in
words, the <em>kitschka</em>, or local head-dress, can best be pictured as a
miniature version of the bonnet characteristic of the Salvation Army
lass. Composed of red velvet, it is neatly draped with a silk kerchief
the shade of the feathers on a pigeon's breast. From the back dangle
two unequal ends, one on top of the other, white edged with red, the
extremities consisting of stiffened squares of scarlet passementerie,
trimmed at the bottom with shallow red fringe.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to the types already mentioned, the costume of
a Tartar woman bears evidence of her Oriental descent, the memory of
which she strives still further to perpetuate by staining her nails
with henna and blackening her eyebrows and hair. She betrays a decided
predilection for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
striped silken textures, which she occasionally varies in favour of
a large all-over pattern. Her ordinary toilet is composed of baggy
trousers concealed beneath a long flowing robe of red and white figured
silk, surmounted by a second shapeless garment to the knees in the
nature of a coat. The last is evolved from striped pink and white silk,
and fastens near the right shoulder with three small metal buttons set
closely together, while through the loosely flapping fronts protrudes
the fringed end of a sumptuously embroidered sash. Covering the head
and shoulders is a sweeping veil of white silk, pin striped with green,
that falls to the ground and envelops the figure after the fashion of a
cloak, slits being provided for the hands to pass through; and although
the Tartars are Mohammedans by religion, the face is left bare.</p>

<p>Although palpably designed for use rather than ornament, the dress
of the women of Kherson is far from being wholly unattractive. A white
kerchief, drawn over the head, falls in points on the shoulders,
concealing the hair, but leaving the ears exposed to show dangling
ear-rings. The chemisette of thick white cotton introduces a touch of
colour at the wrists of the wide sleeves, and the loose sleeveless
bodice reveals a heart-shaped opening in front, and is confined by a
striped scarf wound about the waist and held by a leather belt fastened
with an imposing silver clasp. The narrow fringed apron is of carpet
material over a plain skirt cut short above the ankles to reveal a
gaily-embroidered petticoat.</p>

<p>The ceremonial costume of the women of Simbirsk is very peculiar.
High and square, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
hat is of velvet, with a close brim composed of a broad hand of white
sheep's wool drawn down over the brows, giving the wearer a slightly
lowering expression. A shower of gilt coins jangles in the ears, and
the long-sleeved white tunic fits tightly up to the throat and ceases
abruptly at the knees, where it is met by leggings of white felt
cross-gartered the entire distance, the garters doing double duty,
as they serve as supports for the low shoes. The most extraordinary
and characteristic feature of the entire toilet is a large square
breast-plate of white metal covered with pieces of money and copper
discs, which combine the roles of amulets and ornaments. This odd and
warrior-like decoration is divided across the centre, and so forms
two separate portions, the upper being so arranged that it laps over
the under, when rendered necessary by the movements of the body. In
addition, a small silver cross is worn suspended from a ribbon passed
round the neck.</p>

<p>Specially interesting by reason of the fact that Nijni Novgorod is
the scene of the most important fair in the world, the dress of the
women of the district consists of a fringed and embroidered shawl which
envelops the head and shoulders and is pinned under the chin. As is
only to be expected, fur plays a part in the trimming. The wide jacket
reaches to the waist, and reveals fur cuffs and an edging of fur about
the bottom and up the fronts. Not quite ankle length, the brocade skirt
is bordered with fringe, the plain or brocaded under-skirt descending
to the ground. Both skirts are immensely wide, and suggest the presence
of a hooped petticoat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
The shawl and outer jacket removed, there are attractive revelations of
a sleeveless corsage of brocade and a white chemisette conspicuous for
sleeves that puff with exaggeration at the shoulder and again below the
elbow, finally coming in tightly at the wrist and ending in frills. The
jewellery, as is usual in Russia, is of a ponderous type, and is most
popular in the form of chains, necklaces, and finger-and ear-rings.</p>

<p>The women of the people still plaster their faces crudely with white
and red cosmetics: a mode once in favour with the upper classes, but
now condemned as distinctly bad form and savouring of barbarity.</p>

<p>I cannot leave Russia without some reference to the Jews, who write
now as ever an important chapter in their history.</p>

<p>No Jew can justly be counted a peasant, since no member of the race
is allowed to be a land-owner, his utmost privilege permitting him to
be a tenant farmer. The distinctive garment remains what it has been
through many centuries&mdash;the gaberdine; but some concession is made
to modern opinion by the black peaked cap, which, in place of the old
skull-cap, is worn in the streets by the less prejudiced.</p>

<p>The gaberdine buttons down the front to the waist, hangs to the
ankles, and is usually now made of black cloth, silk, or moir√©, held
at the waist by a folded belt. It is finished at the neck by a soft
turn-down collar attached to an under-shirt, and it conceals from view
loose trousers and high boots; in winter it is lined with fur. The chin
is unshaven, and a pendent curl hangs from either temple; and reverence
for the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
traditions upholds the custom that on the Fast or Atonement day of the
Jews, the patriarch of the family shall attend the synagogue in his
shroud, and that the praying-shawl or <em>taleth</em> of white, with a border
of blue, be worn every day at devotions.</p>

<p>The Jewish women of the poorer class wear a white kerchief over
the head, crossed on the bust of a black sateen jacket, which buttons
on the slant and reaches below the hips. The short skirt beneath is
of a vivid tone of red, covered by a white apron, and the most vital
difference between the Jew and the other races in Russia is the
significant absence of the cross.</p>

<p>The working dress of the Jew consists of a pair of baggy trousers
disappearing into top-boots, and a white shirt drawn into the waist
by a leather belt, surmounted by a round cloth cap, for no religious
Jew ever uncovers his head. The hair would seem to have some special
importance, for no Jewish woman who marries is allowed to retain her
tresses; they are cropped or shaved close to the head, which is covered
by a black satin cap, down the centre of which a white thread is sewn
in imitation of a parting. This sacrifice is demanded of all who would
enjoy matrimony; and the great question as to whether the cause is
worthy has not yet been aired in any halfpenny daily issued at St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>Chancing upon a book of costume, which included details of the dress
worn by a tribe known as the Wotiaks, who inhabit a small village in
Siberia, I learned that the women wear a peculiar costume consisting of
a shift of coarse linen, slit in front like a man's shirt, and hemmed
up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
either side with worsted of different colours. The gown, which is
woollen, somewhat in the shape of the habit of the Jesuits in college,
reaches to the knees, and is fastened by a girdle. The head-dress is
very remarkable and intricate, including much wrapping of a towel, over
which is placed a helmet made of the bark of a tree, ornamented by a
piece of cloth and copecs, and covered with a handkerchief wrought with
worsted of different colours and edged with a fringe.</p>

<p>The Mordvine women, if married, have the privilege of wearing a
high cap worked in coloured threads, with flaps hanging down at the
back, adorned with chains and pendent fringes. The linen petticoats
and aprons show much embroidery of red and blue and many fringes, and
tassels and beads hang down behind.</p>

<p>Linen and ribbons, embroidery and coloured worsted, are the common
features of dresses in all the villages, and the plait of hair, with
strings of coral and ribbon, afford the young girl some opportunity for
coquetry; and at Kirguise there is a head-dress specially worthy of
note. Three or four yards of material are placed on the head, with the
ends hanging on either side of the face, and over this is bound another
stuff to form a turban, the hair being plaited in two and brought up
over the head to fall down again over the ears.</p>

<p>In Cracow the open shirt is decked with collar and wristbands tied
with ribbons, and over this is a tunic reaching to the knee, fastened
in front, and held by a girdle ornamented with copper studs. The cap
of cloth bordered with fur is common in this district as in many
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The dress of the Saxon peasants near Dresden bears a suggestion of
joy in its multi-coloured details. They wear dark petticoats with white
jackets and aprons; and round the neck a scarlet handkerchief, the ends
of which appear under the jacket, and a huge frill tied with a large
blue bow in front and a large crimson one at the back. The hair is
quite hidden by a closely-fitting cap of crimson with a white border,
or a coloured handkerchief is pinned tightly round the head, and big
bows are placed at the back.</p>

<p>The men in the Tyrol wear short coats, bordered and lined with a
bright colour, and they show their polychromatic prejudices further in
their vests of green, yellow, or scarlet, striped with black and white.
Their short trousers reach to their bare knees, and are ornamented
with designs in white thread, and their green felt hats are conical in
shape, with narrow brims, flaunting a bunch of coloured ribbons on one
side.</p>

<p>The dress worn by the women is very pretty, displaying a yellow
or red stomacher and dark bodice, worn over nine or ten full short
petticoats in different colours. The aprons have coloured borders, and
a black handkerchief is crossed over the bosom under the stomacher,
fur being permitted to trim the sleeves when long; but with the short
sleeve the white frill puts in an appearance at the elbow, and black
mittens embroidered in colours cover the hands and arms.</p>

<p>Huge caps with plaited crowns, with a feather or bunch of flowers,
constitute the ordinary head-dress; and the hair is turned back from
the face, braided at the back, and kept in place by very long gold
pins. The stockings have quaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
limitations, reaching only from knee to ankle, and the shoes are of
black leather.</p>

<p>Quaintness is the distinguishing feature of the Dutch peasant, men
and women,&mdash;the latter in their full and very short petticoats,
laced bodice and long tight sleeves, the hair bound and knotted with
ribbons; the former in their closely-fitting coats with monster
pockets, very wide breeches, and long waistcoats.</p>

<p>"I don't like them buttons," a millionaire model once said to his
portrait painter; and a criticism of this kind would come with a
touch of authority from the rich Guelderland peasant, whose costume
is all buttons. Coat, waistcoat, waistband, trousers, and shoes are
all decorated with gold and silver buttons, while at the throat is a
silver clasp, and the women have gold ornaments on their dress and in
their hair, and golden trinkets hang about them everywhere with more
recklessness than reason.</p>

<p>The peasants of French Flanders wear short full petticoats, and a
jacket laced up the front, gold ear-rings and a golden cross being
conspicuous features of their costume, which includes a black bib and a
cap with a pleated border. A short coat of black and a veil of three or
four yards of stuff are added for "walking out."</p>

<p>The Westphalian peasant appears to have an odd taste in headgear,
judging from the picture on page 142, and the black bow which extends
beyond either ear must be stiffened with whalebone to induce it to such
a rectitude of conduct. The small linen turban is held by a piece of
black ribbon, beneath which appears a band of white lawn. Black lends a
picturesque touch to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
front of the low bodice, which is outlined by a handkerchief of white
lawn held in front by two elaborate designs of embroidery; embroidery
of green and black and red putting in its appearance round the hem of
the plain serge skirt.</p>

<p>The comfortable advantage of reindeer skin was appreciated by the
Norwegian peasants in their dress of olden times, and cloaks of this
were generally worn until the city of Bergen was built by King Oluf in
the eleventh century, and the coming of foreign merchants introduced
a variety of new fashions. According to Norwegian chroniclers, the
natives took greedily to fine laced hose, golden plates buckled round
their legs, high-heeled shoes stitched with silk and covered with
tissue of gold, jackets that buttoned on the side, with sleeves ten
feet long, pleated up to the shoulders.</p>

<p>The long reindeer-skin garment did not, however, disappear entirely,
until the rule of short clothes and bare legs was inaugurated by King
Magnus Olufsen.</p>

<p>The varieties of fashion do not seem to affect the peasants now;
they note with indifference the changes of costume, and cling mainly to
the dress which has descended through many generations. Their breeches
and stockings are cut in one; their waistcoats are of woollen material
with the seams covered with cloth of different colour; on their heads
they wear brown, grey, or black caps, or broadly brimmed hats; while
their heel-less shoes are made of two pieces of leather, and the laced
half-boots used in winter are covered with sealskin.</p>

<p>The Swedish peasants are devoted to long coats of cloth lined with
sheepskin, and the women choose their woollen gowns striped with green
and white and red.</p>

<p>The Norwegian f√™te dress consists of a laced jacket and leather
girdle set with silver, and indispensable are many rows of chain
holding a gilt or silver pendant. The kerchief and cap are covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with silver, tin, and brass plates, buttons and rings being used <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad
libitum</i>, and very fine linen is amongst the luxuries.</p>

<p>Almost every parish in Norway has its own colour, a scheme which
might considerably assist the police and municipal authorities in the
sordid byways of crime, or the roseate paths of romance.</p>

<p>The Hungarian peasant women may be noted in passing for their yellow
leather boots and low iron heels, and they study the serviceable and
the beautiful in their many coloured bodices and petticoats, and white
apron and long plaits. The Hungarian peasant woman illustrated shows
the effect of white linen for the head, with the dress of canvas
embroidered in red and blue and violet.</p>

<p>The f√™te dress of the Morlacchi woman is a
gorgeous affair, with a chemisette embroidered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
gold and red, and the blue petticoat upheld by a woollen girdle trimmed
with shells. The stockings are red, and the shoes of undressed leather.
The unmarried women wear strange head ornaments, including a scarlet
cap with a pendent veil, and such decorations as silver coins, glass
beads, feathers, shells, artificial flowers, and glass plumes, all
of which elegancies are dispensed with at the altar, for the matron
enwraps her head with a handkerchief and allows her hair to fall simply
over her shoulders. The virgin conceals her hair with a cap, and
twists beads and coins amongst her locks in approved Tartar fashion.
The married woman is allowed the ease of the Turkish slipper, and all
alike wear strings of beads round the neck, and as many brass and tin
rings as they can obtain; and bracelets of leather covered with wrought
silver or tin, and embroidered stomachers adorned with beads and shells
express the last word of "smartness."</p>

<p>The Finland peasant woman seems to be the only one with a nice
appreciation of brown. She chooses this for her bodice, with a short
skirt of black, and her sleeves are loose and decked with blue and red,
and round her neck are five rows of large beads, while her pendent
ornaments are of beads, and her quaint little apron of blue is striped
with blue and black and a design in yellow and red beads. The white
kerchief covers the head and forehead, falling on to her shoulders, and
round her waist is fastened a belt striped with red and fringed.</p>

<p>But gather your peasant costume where you may, whether in the North
or the West of Europe, you will find its most prominent details the
contrasting colour of the bodice, the blue and red embroidery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the silver and gold ornaments, and the linen and canvas fabrics. The
kerchief and the cap are the distinguishing features, and the shape and
fashion of the jewellery are inspired as often as not by the prevailing
religious rites and the superstitious beliefs of the district.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="p5">OF ORIENTAL DRESS</p>


<p>All over China, and particularly in official circles, dress
is determined by certain fixed laws, the result being that every
detail possesses a meaning for those capable of interpreting it.
The most significant feature is the button which adorns the crowns
of hats peculiar to Mandarins, while embroideries likewise assist
in determining the status of the wearer. Colour is another factor
of importance. Yellow is sacred to the Emperor, the members of the
Imperial family, and those privileged few to whom the sovereign desires
to award the highest honour. Red is exclusively reserved for Mandarins,
but blue, violet, and black are common property.</p>

<p>In the matter of feminine attire, fashion is equally subjective
to legislature, and has varied little throughout the centuries. With
regard to the ladies of the Imperial household, the rules laid down
for their guidance, in the matter of personal adornment, are as
comprehensive as stringent.</p>

<p>Custom not only ordains that the Emperor shall have one hundred and
thirty wives, it also decrees what they shall wear.</p>

<p>As chief wife and equal in all points to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Celestial consort, it is incumbent upon the Empress to be distinguished
from her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entourage</i> by the magnificence of her raiment. For this
she depends upon the materials employed and the embroideries, as the
costume common to all Chinese women of position is modelled on similar
lines, namely, a long under-dress, usually of plain silk, arranged
in stiff, overlapping pleats at the foot. This is surmounted by an
over-dress in a contrasting colour, elaborately embroidered with the
insignia of the husband's rank, and terminating just below the knees,
while the sleeves reach to the wrist, where they are supplemented
by tight inner sleeves, belonging to the under-dress, and almost
completely concealing the hand. The collar is not more than an inch
deep, and is round in shape, a becoming touch being added by a narrow
scarf of soft silk twisted once about the throat, and knotted loosely,
with the ends allowed to hang unevenly in front. A rare illumination
depicts the Empress seated upon a throne of carved wood draped with
green silk. On her head is a cope-like erection edged with dangling
pearl fringe, her jewellery consisting of jade ear-rings and bracelets
contrived from the same precious stone. Her under-robe is sumptuously
embroidered in a dazzling variety of colours, pleated and lined with
gold tissue, while the upper garment is of red silk, worked in an
all-over design of dragons, emblematic of Imperialism by reason of
the distinguishing five claws, the border being of dark blue richly
embroidered in sombre tones. In her right hand she holds the sceptre, a
twisted stick headed by a fabulous bird.</p>

<p>Next in rank to the Empress are the three
wives known by the title of Fou-gin. Etiquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
decrees that they shall wear dresses adorned with feathers worked in
five shades. Inferior again to these are the nine Imperial consorts
known as Pins. To them are assigned robes of brilliant yellow, the
thirty-seven Chi-fous donning white. The lowest wives of all are the
Yu-tsis, eighty in number, and they are doomed to appear in black.</p>

<p>The over-dress common to Chinese ladies is coat-shaped, and opens
up the sides for a considerable distance, another distinctive feature
being the sleeves, which boast a single seam under either arm and are
cut in one with the remainder of the garment, which, in winter, is
lined with the costliest fur.</p>

<p>Considerable attention is devoted to the hair. In Pekin girls
arrange theirs in tufts on the temples, while the back hangs down in
multitudinous plaits. As soon as they become engaged they turn it up
and thrust a silver pin, a foot in length, through the thick tresses.
This pin, by the way, is as significant of betrothal as is the ring
in Europe. On her wedding day the bride's hair is shaven in front, to
heighten the forehead, and the remainder braided and coiled about a
stiff black silk frame which rests on the nape of the neck. This done,
flowers, feathers, glass ornaments, or, for the rich, jewellery set
with uncut stones, are added. A popular style on ordinary occasions is
to twist the hair into outstanding bunches at either ear and decorate
the excrescences with flowers.</p>

<p>A small foot is highly esteemed as a beauty, and causes its
possessor to be ardently sought after in marriage. The practice,
however, of mutilating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the feet in order to achieve the desired result is limited to one
daughter out of five in each family, while the women of Tartary disdain
the notion altogether. The diminutive foot, erroneously held to be
typical of all Chinese ladies of rank, is encased in a silk or cotton
slipper raised on a thick, inclined sole. Those who are incapable of
getting into a shoe compared with which Cinderella's glass slipper
would appear gigantic, have recourse to the stratagem of wearing a
similar model fitted with a high heel set in the middle of the sole.
Perched on such an uncertain support, they walk with the mincing
steps and swaying gait which, for them, constitute the acme of grace,
but which, in barbarian eyes, suggest nothing more alluring than an
imminent danger of toppling over.</p>

<p>Abnormally long finger-nails are likewise held to enhance the
natural charms of lovely woman, and the use of cosmetics is freely
indulged in. A fan is always carried, and frequently a pipe,
conspicuous for a diminutive bowl and long slender stem.</p>

<p>As representing officialdom, the Mandarins, or Kwans, as they are
called in their own country, are quite the most important body of men
in the Celestial Empire. They are divided into nine classes, each of
which is subdivided into two. A glance at the button on the hat is
sufficient to determine the rank of the wearer.</p>

<p>The significance attached to this particular decoration is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The last class of all is similarly represented by a gold button. The
button employed on ceremonial occasions differs from that worn every
day, in that it is round, whereas the latter is oblong.</p>

<p>Another distinctive feature of a Mandarin's dress is the
pectoral&mdash;a small piece of material attached to the breast. In the
case of civil dignitaries it is embroidered with birds, while in that
of military authorities it displays quadrupeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>A CHINESE ACTOR.</p></div>

<p>The official costume consists of a long, loose gown which opens
up the centre and is gorgeously embroidered with dragons or winged
serpents. The claws further testify to the rank of the wearer, those
dragons possessing three or four being the exclusive privilege of
members of the first four classes, who are also entitled to wear
peacock's feathers at the back of their hats, and chains of coral, the
red parasol being another of their prerogatives. Over the under-robe is
worn an ample coat of plain silk extending below the knees. This has
wide sleeves, which allow a view of tight under-sleeves pertaining to
the embroidered robe, and drawn down to cover the hands, and shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
at the ends in the form of a horseshoe. About the waist is a deep
embroidered band, that serves as pocket in case of need, while a
square, embroidered collar rests on the shoulders and tapers up to
vanishing point at the throat in front. The hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hangs in a tightly-plaited pigtail, lengthened by the addition of
false tresses, and the characteristic hat boasts a brim of satin,
velvet, or fur, shaped like a saucer, its red crown surmounted by the
all-important button. The shoes are those which a man of position must
always wear in public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Sabot-shaped, with thick soles, they are covered in silk, satin, or
cotton, and there is no difference between the right and left foot.
A coveted military distinction is a fox's tail arranged at the back
of the hat. The most signal mark of Imperial favour, however, is
permission to wear a yellow coat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>In his everyday attire the Mandarin observes none of these elaborate
formul√¶. He dons a loose robe of silk to the ankles, an umbrella-shaped
hat, and heel-less shoes with pointed toes that curve slightly upwards,
contrived from rattan plaited in such a manner as to allow freely of
ventilation. In his right hand he carries a fan and in his left a
checked handkerchief of imposing dimensions.</p>

<p>The ordinary dress of men of the middle classes comprises a short
shirt cut low at the throat, drawers, socks of material made with a
single seam up the back, a long embroidered coat, and a shorter jacket
of some plain fabric, held by a broad waist-belt, embroidered in
colours and fastened by a jade ornament.</p>

<p>The headgear differs according to the season. In summer a
conical-shaped straw hat is chosen, and in winter small hats obtain
either of hard felt with stiff, upturned brims or of felt soft and
pliable.</p>

<p>The costume of the lower orders is simplicity itself. A cotton
shirt, trousers, and a loose sleeveless coat exhaust the list. A narrow
strip of material is tied round the waist in order to prevent the
clothing getting in the worker's way, and the naked feet are thrust
into low sandals.</p>

<p>Occasionally the ubiquitous pigtail is turned
up and pinned in a coil about the head, but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
liberty is never permitted in the presence of a superior. As a matter
of fact, the etiquette of dress is rigidly observed throughout China.
No gentleman would dream of either paying or receiving a visit without
shoes on his feet, a fan in his hand, and a wide, pointed hat, rather
suggestive of a tent, on his head. How true it is that manners, like
morals, are mere matters of geography!</p>

<p>In contrast to the love of display characteristic of their Chinese
neighbours, the Japanese are conspicuous for extreme simplicity.
This national trait finds expression in their dress. Here I pause
to consider whether, as a chronicler of costume, I should allude to
the Japanese in the present or past tense? I regretfully incline to
the latter view, for there is little doubt that the smoke of factory
chimneys, built on European lines and fed with Cardiff coal, is rapidly
blurring local colour. Already the quaint little men have adopted the
outward and visible sign of inward civilisation in the form of a frock
coat and top hat. Their women-folk have followed their example and
discarded the picturesque for the prosaic, exchanging the fashions
transmitted by their ancestresses for those telegraphed from Paris.
Will the Geishas do likewise, and is another decade destined to see
them in caps and aprons, and will&mdash;Imagination fails me, and I
revert to the glorious days of the Daimios and Samourais&mdash;days
for which, I am firmly convinced, every frock-coated Japanese sighs as
ardently as I do.</p>

<p>In old Japan social distinctions were drawn for all time, and there
was no crossing the line of demarcation. Society was divided into nine grades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The princes, or Daimios, the nobles, or Samourai, the priests, and the
military composed the first four. These were entitled to carry two
swords, while the intellectual class, which numbered doctors in its
ranks, was allowed one. The remainder, including lawyers, were debarred
the privilege of bearing arms.</p>

<p>From the age of seven the son of a Samourai appeared in public
wearing the two swords distinctive of his rank. They were small, of
course, as appropriate to his size and strength, but were otherwise
perfect in every detail.</p>

<p>Despite rigorously-observed social divisions, all classes wore the
same outer garment, the difference being in the materials employed.
Until the influx of Europeans made its levelling influence felt, the
use of silk by any but the nobility was strictly prohibited. The
article of attire common to both sexes of the community was the kimono,
a loose, flowing wrap which opened down the centre and crossed over
at the breast, where on men it was held in place by a narrow belt,
while women wore a wide sash neatly folded and tied in an elaborate
bow behind. Although the sleeves were immensely wide and hung in deep
points, only a small opening was left for the hand to pass through, the
remainder being joined together to serve as pocket. Etiquette exacting
that what a guest could not eat he should take home, the superfluous
dainties were carefully enveloped in paper and deposited in the roomy
sleeves.</p>

<p>Handkerchiefs were of tissue paper, and were carried in the
belt; while no Japanese, of either sex or any rank, from the Mikado
downwards, would consent to even a momentary separation from his or her
fan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Masculine costume consisted of tight trousers to the calf and the
loose, round shirts, which were fashioned from white material for the
people and from greyish-blue silk for the nobility; and labourers
displayed on theirs the insignia of their special craft or of the
corporation to which they belonged. Common to all classes were high
wooden clogs and sandals of plaited straw. Peculiar to the aristocracy
and certain regiments, notably the archers, were short trousers of
brilliantly-coloured silk, cut so immensely wide as to suggest the
petticoats of a ballet girl. On ceremonious occasions the feet and legs
were left bare. Stockings were cut out of cotton, or stuff, neatly
seamed up the back, and were made with a division at the great toe for
the thong of the sandal. On the whole, subdued shades and dark colours
predominated, the Japanese being distinguished by the quiet elegance of
their taste.</p>

<p>Typical of the headgear affected by the lower classes in warm
weather was a huge straw hat in the form of a dish-cover. Another
characteristic example, likewise of straw, resembled a round,
deep-edged tray, the brim turned downwards, and the whole was held in
place by means of a chin-strap.</p>

<p>Women, as a rule, left the head uncovered, preferring to rely for
protection upon flat umbrellas made of paper, cotton, or silk. They
drew their hair off the forehead, dressing it in neat puffs or coils
and decorating it with large, ornamental pins, flowers, and ribbons,
but neither ear-rings nor any other articles of jewellery were worn.</p>

<p>Married women were distinguished by their blackened teeth and the
fact that their eyebrows were shaved and their faces unpainted. They wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a long robe of red <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cr√™pe de chine</i> which folded over at the breast
leaving a V-shaped opening at the throat. Their pet vanity was to
arrange their under-garments so that the border of each formed a
regular trimming at the neck, a glance sufficing to show how many were
worn&mdash;the greater the number the greater the success achieved. On
the back and sleeves of their trailing silk kimonos were embroidered
the arms of their house. When walking, or otherwise inconvenienced by
folds of material clinging about their feet, they tucked the kimonos
into the belt, a pretty fashion which revealed the gaily-coloured gown
beneath and the high wooden clogs.</p>

<p>The only difference between the dress of women of the upper and
lower classes was the employment of cotton instead of silk.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that European influence has done much towards
imposing European costume upon the Japanese, the influence is as yet
restricted to Tokio and other industrial centres. In rural districts
the national dress is still sacred, and the country-man remains a
quaintly picturesque figure to delight the visitor from across seas,
who recognises in him the prototype of the carved ivory models of the
glass cabinet and curio table.</p>

<p>From the land of the chrysanthemum to that of the Pyramids is a far
cry, and in point of fact no more dissimilar types could be imagined
than those of old Japan and ancient Egypt. Woman's dress characteristic
of the latter country was marked by a shamelessness of display and a
unique brilliancy of colour, the effect of the scanty garments in vivid
tones accentuating rather than concealing the natural lines and curves
of the figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">

<div class="caption"><p>AN EGYPTIAN PEASANT WOMAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The chief article of attire would seem to have been the deep
circular collar worn round the throat, and this was typical of both
sexes and of all ranks of the community with the exception of the very
meanest. It was composed of jewels, metal, enamel work, or beads,
according to the position of the wearer. Feminine dress consisted of a
tight sleeveless robe, better described perhaps as a clinging skirt,
of a texture adapted to define the figure, reaching to the ankles, and
extending a few inches above the waist. It was held in place by a pair
of straps which were joined in the centre and, separating, passed over
the shoulders to meet again behind. The bust and arms were bare, the
latter adorned with bracelets at the wrist and again above the elbow.
Anklets were worn, and occasionally big circular ear-rings.</p>

<p>The treatment of the hair was extremely elaborate and difficult,
calling for the exercise of considerable skill and patience. Cut
straight across the forehead, it was arranged with mathematical
precision in several rows of fine plaits, the clubbed ends terminating
immediately below the nape of the neck. As a coiffure of this kind
necessitated an enormous expenditure of time and labour, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
classes of society had recourse to wigs, the rich employing natural
hair for the purpose, and the poor, wool. A typical example of a
fashionable perruque took the form of a densely-braided mass which
covered the head as efficaciously as a mat, one large plait coming
down at either side of the face, and curving round on the shoulder in
the shape of an elephant's trunk. The crown of the head was usually
encircled by a slender golden fillet, which, in the case of a Pharaoh,
or a royal lady, was twined about with the ur√¶us, emblem of supreme
sovereignty. The head of the sacred asp reared threateningly in the
centre of the forehead. Cleopatra&mdash;not the famous Cleopatra of
Mark Antony, but one of her five predecessors&mdash;is represented
with the bare bosom, naked arms, circular collar, and skin-tight skirt
common to her countrywomen. A noteworthy feature is that her dress, of
bright blue and white material, shows horizontal stripes to the knees,
where it is joined by a slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fuller flounce with the stripes running vertically. It is supported
by scarlet shoulder-straps, and the ribbon encircling the crown of
the head is in the same shade, knotted at the back, where it hangs
in two short ends. The wig is arranged in multitudinous plaits that
rest on the shoulders at either side and descend midway to the waist
behind. Above the forehead rears the royal asp, and over it tower two
straight quills, which form a background for the horns of a ram between
which glares a flaming sun; these quills, by the way, typify absolute
sovereignty.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>AN EGYPTIAN WATER-CARRIER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The head-covering in general use consisted of a piece of material
shaped to rest flat on the top of the head and describe a curve in
front, with a straight, narrow tab cut up at the side to allow free
passage for the shoulder, the back hanging curtain-wise to afford
ample protection to the nape of the neck. The textures employed for
such purposes were cotton, linen, and wool decorated with stripes or

<p>The men, as well as the women, glittered with bracelets, anklets,
and other jewellery of a massive and showy type. White was preferred
to colours for their clothing; and the habitual costume for men was of
the scantiest possible description, being nothing more or less than a
sleeveless tunic held up by shoulder-straps, a narrow piece of ribbon
being tied round the waist, terminating in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
short ends in front. This skirt or tunic reached to the knee or calf,
and sometimes even as far as the ankle; the legs, arms, and chest were
bare, and the face clean-shaven.</p>

<p>A great warrior is depicted wearing a tightly-fitting shirt of
mail composed of bronze scales sewn on to soft leather, displaying
short sleeves and descending below the knees, a white metal gauntlet
protecting the left wrist. On the head is a high, narrow helmet which
completely conceals the hair, and from it floats three pendent ends of
striped material. About the throat is a jewelled and enamelled collar,
and from a thick gold chain hangs a large gold ornament engraved with
figures.</p>

<p>It is known that the finest and most transparent muslins were first
manufactured by the ancient Egyptians, and doubtless these were used
for making dresses; indeed in proof of this many representations are
extant of female musicians clad in diaphanous muslin through which the
body can be clearly seen. The loose robe is drawn under the right arm
and fastened on the left shoulder.</p>

<p>Did Egyptian women ever grow old, I wonder, and if so, what did they
wear? The artists have left us no record save of the eternal feminine
eternally youthful.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="p5">OF ORIENTAL DRESS (<i>continued</i>)</p>


<p>"And never the twain shall meet," lilts Kipling of the East and the
West; and in the province of dress, as everywhere else in the Orient,
caste, ruling supreme, writes incontroversial laws of separation.</p>

<p>In India, the article of masculine attire to which most importance
attaches is the turban, its shape and general aspect denoting the
social and spiritual status of the wearer.</p>

<p>Until the founding of the Mogul Empire in 1505, the women of
Hindostan were strangers to the tyranny both of the Zenana and of the
veil, but from that time onwards traces of Mohammedan influence are
plainly visible in the habits and costume of the people.</p>

<p>The utmost magnificence and display characterised the dress of the
Mogul Emperors and their Court; and although differing in colour,
texture, and certain minute details, the costumes common to the period
were identical in broad outline and general design; and Fashion moved
so slowly in a country where tradition was regarded as law, that the
sleeve and collar in vogue at the end of a century were very like those
obtaining at the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>A prince of the Mogul dynasty, who is depicted in a dress typical of
his time and rank, wears long, tightly-fitting pyjamas of striped red
and gold material, very much rucked at the calf and terminating at the
ankle. His feet are encased in embroidered slippers, which leave the
heel bare, the pointed toes curling upwards. The over-dress reaches to
below the knee, and is of transparent white tissue, the skirt pleated
and held at the waist by a sash, worked in gold, scarlet, and black,
knotted in front and with fringed ends falling in unequal lengths.
A jewel-hilted dagger is worn at the left side, and a narrow scarf,
in white and gold, crosses the breast, passing under the right arm
and over the left shoulder, where one end hangs down behind and the
other before. The closely-fitting sleeves are rucked, and bracelets
are drawn over them at the wrist and above the elbow, while several
rows of pearls appear at the neck. The small white turban is arranged
in a point on the forehead and encircled by a broad gold band and a
string of pearls, the latter raised in front by an enormous emerald, a
superb aigrette waving above an ornament glittering with diamonds and
other precious stones; and on state occasions a large sword, sheathed
in crimson velvet, and with a cross-shaped hilt studded with jewels,
was carried, another mark of Imperial dignity being the umbrella which
overspread the throne.</p>

<p>The dress of high-born ladies was very similar to that of the men,
for it, too, consisted of rucked trousers, of brilliantly-coloured
silk, decorated with embroidery and confined at the feet with plain
gold bangles or jewelled anklets. The pointed slippers curved up at the
toes and left the heels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
exposed, and the pleated robe of transparent muslin terminated at the
calf. From the waist in front a width of gold tissue, fringed and
worked in various bright shades, hung apron-like, while the bust was
supported by a corselet contrived from polished wood so light and so
supple as in nowise to interfere with the lithe movements of the body.
The arms were bare, excepting for bracelets at the wrists and above
the elbow, and the head and upper portion of the figure were enveloped
in the graceful folds of a sari, or immense veil of diaphanous texture
bordered with gold and patterned in vivid colours. The hair was parted,
and fell in plaits behind, a jewelled ornament being worn in the centre
of the forehead; while a pearl was fastened into one nostril, and the
nails were stained vermilion.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/i_b_165.jpg" width="225" height="600" alt="" title="AN OLD INDIAN FESTIVAL DRESS" />
<div class="caption"><p>AN OLD INDIAN FESTIVAL DRESS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Court dignitaries are represented in long, loose garments coming
below the knees and cut low at the throat to reveal a vest of fine
white material, but otherwise identical in design with the ordinary
dressing-gown of a man of to-day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
waist was encircled by a broad band of embroidery, and the trousers
completely encased the feet. On the head was the inevitable turban,
round in shape and wide of brim.</p>

<p>Under the British Raj, India retains her picturesque variety of
costume, and remains the one land faithful to the traditions of the
turban. Hardly less splendid than in the gorgeous days of the Mogul
Empire is the dress of a modern prince of the caste of Rajput. A small
red turban is wound tightly about the head, one short gold-bedizened
end falling behind. The big ear-rings are crescent-shaped, and the
necklace is composed of several rows of pearls. A white robe falls to
the ankles, and is surmounted by a shorter yellow jacket embroidered in
colours and held together at the waist by a sash of peacock blue satin,
the gold fringed ends falling unevenly in front. The tight sleeves
terminate at the elbow, where they are supplemented by white ones,
which extend to the wrist.</p>

<p>Scarlet and white are the favourite contrast, and the effect is to
make the crowded bazaars brilliant and attractive to the eye.</p>

<p>A costume characteristic of a Pathan, a Musulman by religion,
consists of a white turban of voluminous proportions wound in such a
manner as to form a wide brim. The tight trousers are clearly visible
through a flowing robe of figured white cotton, which reaches nearly
to the ground, and, crossing over at the breast, is kept in place by a
striped shawl folded about the waist, the picture being completed by
velvet slippers turned up at the toes. The coolies are generally naked
except for a loin-cloth and turban, but some wear a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
cotton shirt, short-sleeved and held by a folded belt in some bright
shade.</p>

<p>Brahmins are distinguished by the sacred cord, in reality a twisted
rope of cotton, which hangs from the left shoulder to the middle of
the thigh. A typical costume is evolved from a long, straight piece
of material wound round the body from the waist downwards, and drawn
between the legs to form a trouser-like division. A shawl, draped about
the upper portion of the figure, is manipulated in such a way as to
cross on the left shoulder, one end hanging in front and the other
behind. A shako-shaped turban and a chaplet of beads put the finishing
touches, while on the forehead, breast, and bare arms the mark of the
sect is painted with white powder.</p>

<p>From the age of seven, Parsees of both sexes don the sadra or
sacred surplice emblematic of the coat of mail worn in ancient times
by the Guebers to ward off the attacks of Ahriman, spirit of evil. The
dress of the men comprises light, baggy trousers, white stockings,
flat-heeled slippers, a tight black coat, usually of alpaca, buttoned
down the front, and a high sugar-loaf hat of shiny black.</p>

<p>Nothing more charming could be devised than the dress peculiar to
the female followers of Zoroaster. Until she marries the Parsee girl
wears wide trousers fashioned from brilliantly-hued silk or satin,
and the hems of the legs are adorned with bands of embroidery in
quaint designs of birds and beasts worked in the most gorgeous tints.
Her inner garment is a long sleeved jacket of white muslin, over
which comes the sadra, or loose, square tunic lacking sleeves, and
distinguished by the magnificence of its embroideries. The hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
divided in the centre and hanging down behind, is crowned by a little
circular cap of black velvet covered with gold and silver embroidery
and studded with seed pearls, while on the feet are gaily-embroidered
slippers. Etiquette decrees that before her wedding the Parsee woman
must submit to having her head shaved, a martyrdom which is responsible
for the nun-like band of white material drawn low on the forehead. She
continues to wear the trousers, but exchanges the decorative sadra for
an even more superb sari. This voluminous drapery is of gold-bordered
muslin in warm weather, at other seasons a long, straight piece of silk
or satin wondrously coloured and exquisitely embroidered. It is wound
round and round the body, outlining it tightly at the back, and hanging
in straight folds in front, each evolution being accomplished in
pleats, to attain sufficient fulness; and finally the end is drawn over
the head, concealing one ear and leaving the other exposed, a practice
which explains the single earring worn by Parsee women. In warm weather
the sari is of muslin and boasts a wide gold border.</p>

<p>The principal item in the wardrobe of the Hindu woman is likewise
the sari, which she arranges as the Parsee does hers. The texture
varies according to the means of the wearer. The poor employ cotton,
but they invariably endeavour to have an ornamental border of some
kind. The simply-made skirt reaches to the ankles, and the chuli, a
short-sleeved jacket of diminutive proportions, terminates immediately
below the bust, leaving the middle of the figure uncovered excepting
for the sari. The hair is twisted in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
heavy coil low down on the nape of the neck, a style rendered necessary
by the custom of carrying weights on the head.</p>

<p>The poor Hindu, distrustful of other securities, invests such
worldly wealth as he possesses in jewellery for his wife, who appears
laden with bracelets, of painted wood or coloured glass. As many as
twelve rings jingle from the much-pierced rim of either ear, while an
ornament, frequently of preposterous size, is affixed to one nostril,
and in addition there are anklets, necklaces, and toe and finger
rings.</p>

<p>If the outdoor dress of Persian women be any criterion, their
husbands must be the most jealous in the world, for not one of the
charms accredited to frail femininity is allowed to transpire. The veil
and all-enveloping mantle maintain a profound reserve, so that whether
the wearer be old or young, slender or stout, attractive or repulsive,
remains for ever an impenetrable mystery. Before quitting the seclusion
of the Andaran, the Persian woman assumes an effective disguise. First
she draws on a pair of dark green or grey trousers, one leg at a time,
for there is no connection between the two, and these are fastened at
the waist by a belt. Their shape is peculiar; for, baggy to the knees,
they fit closely at the calf and encase the foot after the manner of
a stocking. Over these is worn an ample mantle of black silk, cotton,
or muslin, covering the head and shrouding the entire figure, the ends
drawn up at the bust and held by strings, which are crossed and tied
round the neck. A thick white veil&mdash;an essential item from the age
of nine&mdash;falls from the forehead to the waist in front, and is
pinned at the back of the head to keep it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
place, a narrow insertion of net appearing at the eyes, to allow sight
to the wearer.</p>

<p>The indoor dress of a Persian lady consists of a full skirt to the
ankles, fashioned from cloth of gold, velvet, or some other costly
fabric, trimmed with beautiful embroidery. A loose jacket of soft white
muslin, decorated with a peculiar kind of lace, forms a vest in front
beneath an open embroidered jacket of a shade contrasting with that
of the skirt. This jacket reaches to the waist, and has long sleeves
conspicuous for turned-back cuffs. A cashmere shawl is draped on the
shoulders, and a white veil is arranged kerchief-wise on the head and
fastened under the chin with a jewelled brooch, leaving only the oval
of the face visible. The brows are encircled by a golden fillet, from
the centre of which depends a jewel, while the hair is parted and hangs
down behind in three or more plaits, their ends tied with gay ribbons
or weighted with pearls or silk tassels.</p>

<p>A variation of this style is noted in the dress of the ladies of
Trebizond, their cashmere shawl being smaller and arranged over the
skirt in such a way that a point falls down behind. The snowy muslin
chemisette is cut low at the throat, and the embroidered coat shows a
heart-shaped opening fastening only at the waist with two buttons; and
on the head is a small round cap.</p>

<p>Female servants are generally barefooted, their full skirts
terminating midway to the ankles, and pulled low down on the hips, so
that the short white under-jacket and little coat of coloured material
terminating at the waist, expose the centre of the body to view.</p>

<p>The official classes have discarded the turban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
in favour of the fez, a closely-fitting cap some six inches in height,
contrived from black cloth or astrakhan. These are plain, with the
exception of the jewelled fez peculiar to the Shah, and of the caps of
certain high military authorities, which bear a distinctive badge of a
gold lion and sun affixed above the forehead, a field-marshal wearing
two lions surmounted by a crown. The turbans of the priests are large
and round, those characteristic of the Seyyids, the direct descendants
of Ali, being in a bright shade of green. As a rule, the official
classes wear trousers and black frock coats that differ from those
customary in Europe only in that they are arranged in numerous pleats,
which, commencing at the hips, continue round the back. Infinitely
more characteristic is the costume affected by merchants, this section
of the community exhibiting a partiality for lightish blue cloth of
native manufacture. The long coat, or ghaba, is loose and flowing.
Double-breasted, it laps over and fastens with two buttons, while about
the waist a shawl is wound several times, knotted, and the ends tucked
out of sight. The overcoat, or aba, is of rough brown material, open in
front, and the wide sleeves terminate at the elbow. A towering fez or a
rolled turban is worn, according to the taste of the wearer.</p>

<p>The priests, or Mullahs, affect much the same style of garb; and, as
I write, one whom I knew rises up before me. His was a most imposing
personality. Of middle height, he seemed much taller by reason of his
large white turban and ample robe of dark blue that flowed to his
ankles, revealing heel-less shoes of bright yellow leather. Round in
shape, his head was shaven, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
beard was trimmed to a point and stained with henna. About his waist a
white shawl was wrapped six times, and into it was tucked a big striped
cotton handkerchief. In his hand he carried a rosary composed of a
hundred clay beads, and, when he walked, the dignity of his demeanour
was further enhanced by a long white mantle which he wore flung over
his right shoulder.</p>

<p>Persians eschew gaudy colours and striking contrasts in dress,
preferring quiet shades and harmonious combinations; dull reds, dim
blues, and sombre greens being favourite tints. The diplomatic uniform
is black, the front of the tight coat one blaze of gold embroidery; and
the official sword is suspended from a narrow belt.</p>

<p>In Turkey, as elsewhere, international intercourse has gradually
led to the disappearance of those salient features which make for
the characteristic in dress. In Constantinople the official classes
wear the conventional garb of Western Europe, with the one noteworthy
exception of the fez, a red cloth cap surmounted by a black silk
tassel. French fashions are permitted in the privacy of the harem, but
etiquette decrees that the women, before they go out, shall exchange
these for a simple toilet of nun-like severity; and the ladies of the
Sultan's household, who are never seen in public unless in a carriage
or boat, don an all-enveloping mantle of black silk in winter and of
some light shade in summer; and over this two white veils are worn. The
first covers the face as far as the bridge of the nose, and the second
is drawn across the brows, shrouding the head and leaving only the eyes
visible. But in truth these yashmaks are so transparent that they serve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
enhance rather than conceal the charms, natural and artificial, of the
wearer. Through the shimmering white drapery the flower-decked hair is
clearly seen, and romantic in the extreme is the effect of a small boat
with three rowers, and a veiled figure under a fluttering lace parasol,
gliding swiftly over the sun-kissed waters of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>The walking dress in vogue in modern Constantinople is even plainer.
It consists of a black silk skirt and a silk cape to the waist, the
cape being provided with an additional piece to cover the head, and
an essential complement is a short veil of close black net. In summer
black is exchanged for light colours, but the style remains the
same.</p>

<p>The priests, with true ecclesiastical fidelity to tradition, have
remained constant to the old-world style of dressing; and to this day
they cut picturesque figures in a red fez encircled by a narrow white
turban, loose trousers kept in place by a cashmere shawl, dark yellow
in colour and of great beauty of design, and a black caftan, a garment
almost identical with that of the cassock worn by the clergy of the
Church of England.</p>

<p>Another survival which is familiar to the casual visitor to
Constantinople is the dress of certain labourers, consisting of baggy
pantaloons to the knee or a little beyond, red shoes, a long sleeved
cotton shirt, and a short, sleeveless jacket of blue or black material,
a red fez, and a coloured shawl about the waist.</p>

<p>Formerly fur trimmings denoted great opulence and luxury, and
the skins most favoured were ermine, sable, marten, white fox, and
squirrel, which were changed according to a prescribed formula. The
date for one to be discarded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
another substituted was fixed by the Sultan, who usually elected to
appear in new clothes on a Friday, when attending mosque. The Grand
Vizier was officially notified of the intended change, whereupon he
immediately sent word to the entire Court, who hastened to follow the
sovereign's example.</p>

<p>The outdoor dress of ladies in those days was a lengthy mantle of
dark material, which boasted long sleeves and a deep sailor collar of
red, blue, or green satin; essential accessories being the two white
veils and top boots of yellow morocco. Heavy and sumptuous, the gown
worn at home consisted of baggy trousers of thin texture drawn in
tightly at the ankles, supplemented by a long sleeved chemisette of
white muslin trimmed with a peculiar kind of lace. This was met at the
bust by the dress proper, a trailing robe of rich material encircled by
an embroidered belt fastened by a jewelled clasp and drawn down very
low in front. The sleeveless velvet mantle was edged with velvet and
fell to the ground, and on the head was a high turban of embroidered
muslin surrounded by a gold fillet set with diamonds, rubies, and
emeralds. The hair was cut in a straight fringe across the forehead,
and arranged in bands over the ears.</p>

<p>Turkish women have always displayed a great fondness for jewellery,
and modern etiquette renders a diamond tiara incumbent upon the bride
of any social standing whatsoever.</p>

<p>Much of the fascination of the desert, its mystery and its appeal
to the imagination, is embodied in the Arab. The eye travels over the
tall figure, straight as a palm tree, draped in the long folds of the
burnous, with the same baffled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sense of inquiry, the same subdued excitement and expectation with
which it looks across the arid sand stretching out to the horizon and
beyond. What restless fever consumes this statuesque figure, impelling
him ever to be on the move? Where does his quest lead amid the dunes
and burning sand, and what is the power that keeps him eternally a
wanderer in that silent land? Vaguely one realises the subtle affinity
between the two&mdash;the nameless spell which the desert casts over
her sons.</p>

<p>The dress of the Arab, picturesque though it is, would seem to have
been expressly designed with a view to affording the utmost possible
protection to the head. The cachi, a little felt cap, red, brown, or
white, and surmounted by a silk tassel in a contrasting shade, is
common to all. Two, and frequently three, are worn, one above the
other, the topmost being invariably red. Concealing the cachi is the
ha√Øk, an ample white drapery drawn low on the forehead and falling
curtain-wise about the face. It is held in place by one or more
tightly-fitting rings composed of camel's or goat's hair, pressed
firmly down on the head, and is of such liberal dimensions as to
envelop the entire figure above a shirt contrived from fine white wool.
Over all is flung the burnous, a voluminous mantle of plain or striped
material which can be arranged in a variety of ways. Sometimes it is
tied at the throat with strings tipped with tassels, and at others it
is wrapped about the body in classic folds with one end flung over the
left shoulder. Sandals are worn on the bare feet, and the beard is long
and pointed.</p>

<p>The costume of the chief of a warrior tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
differs in detail, although retaining the characteristic features. The
sandals are supplemented by high leather side-pieces, open up the front
and with the tops decorated with tassels. The short, tightly-fitting
coat is trimmed with embroidery and more tassels, and reveals a wide
expanse of white vest and a folded belt of brilliantly-hued silk. The
baggy trousers terminate at the knees, where they are met by striped
stockings. The hips are encircled by a shawl, which is knotted at the
left side; and on the head is the inevitable ha√Øk, surmounted by a
large saucer-brimmed hat composed of feathers and conspicuous for a
dome-shaped crown. The burnous fastens with tassels at the throat, and
is flung back from the shoulders, tassels reappearing at rare intervals
round the hem.</p>

<p>In towns Arab women are always more or less veiled, while those
leading the free life of the desert dispense with what they deem
superfluous drapery and choose for ordinary occasions attire of
the scantiest description, merely consisting of a simple robe to
the ankles, sleeveless and confined by a narrow girdle. On days of
grand ceremonial this is exchanged for a long, flowing gown, the
hem and elbow-sleeves edged with fringe, and draped with big cotton
handkerchiefs in vivid plaid designs. One of these is drawn closely
round the head, and the ends are flung back to float behind in
picturesque disarray; a second is pinned at the right hip and again on
the left shoulder; from the neck hang bead chains, and every available
item of enamelled jewellery is displayed on different parts of the
body. The pendent silver ear-rings are of imposing size and weight, and
wide bracelets cover the arms, while, in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
a woman fortunate enough to be the mother of a son, a distinguishing
ornament dangles in the centre of the forehead, whence the hair is
drawn back and arranged in a coil on the nape of the neck. This jewel
she forfeits upon the birth of a daughter, and she recovers it only if
she be blessed by another son.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="p5">OF FANCY DRESS</p>


<p>The fancy-dress ball of private enterprise has nowadays
comparatively little patronage. The hostess is willing, but the guest
is weak, and while idleness is at the root of most social pleasure,
the effort required to assume the virtue or vice of some other
personality is placed without the pale of popularity. There have been,
of course, some historical exceptions, such as the famous balls given
by the Duchess of Devonshire and the Countess of Warwick, but similar
triumphs seem scarcely possible except in these exalted circles, when
the attendance is great because not to be present is to argue yourself
unasked.</p>

<p>There are public fancy-dress balls in plenty, and the Ice Carnival
has just lived its little day&mdash;or night, and now and again some
daring creature, unversed in the ways of her world, issues invitations
with the words "Fancy Dress" printed on the corner of the card, which
declares her determination to be "At Home" at some club or another. But
disappointment generally waits upon the result: the numbers who accept
are few, and of these many will consider themselves exempt from wearing
the motley, and will beg the question in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Windsor uniform of red facings to the dress coat. Most men candidly
confess to feeling themselves fools arrayed in any but the most
conventional costume, and it is only the vanity of a few that will
yield to the attractions of being a velvet-clad Cavalier, a slashed
Romeo, or a bedizened Beaucaire. A woman, on the other hand, delights
in being somebody else, and scarcely a country house party comes to
its close in winter time without some attempt at dressing up, the
"head-dress" dinner being quite an established function, whence,
without doubt, much amusement may be evolved and much ingenuity result.
The success of the head-dress in influencing the entire appearance
gives, of course, proof to my favourite dogma, that the crowning point
is the point of importance in costume.</p>

<p>Time and opportunity in the past have exhausted the decorative
delights of simulating some flower, but although such tactics are
distinctly common-place, yet few frocks look prettier than these when
well planned. One of the most successful I can recall represented a
fuchsia, and it had a purple velvet skirt cut in pointed tabs, and bore
an over-skirt similarly treated of crimson silk; the tight-fitting
short bodice was of the palest green, cream-coloured stockings in
pale green satin shoes appeared beneath these, while the hat was an
entire fuchsia, violet, purple, green, and cream being all disposed
in their proper places. This was easy enough to make, and facility
must be an advantage, even as economy, in the planning of a dress for
the carnival, since, after all, it is scarcely likely to make its
appearance on more than one occasion. An original idea for which we can
give thanks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Fates is the Gooseberry-fool's dress, which may be compassed with
petticoats of pale-green silk fringed with gooseberries of padded silk,
and on the head a fool's cap with pendent gooseberries as bells.</p>

<p>As a dress easy of achievement I can quote that one sketched here
in colour, the Seville Orange. The dress and bodice of orange-coloured
silk bear an application of padded oranges and leaves on the skirt,
beneath a chenille fringe of black with heavy netting, velvet streamers
and oranges are used at discretion to adorn the hair, and the
petticoats beneath the yellow skirt are of green, the stockings and
shoes being of the same tone.</p>

<p>At a fancy-dress ball the costume which is merely original and
not pretty should be condemned except when the novelty prize is the
desideratum of the occasion. There have been some remarkable costumes
designed, which have proclaimed every scientific invention, and others
which have illustrated topical scenes and current events, involving
much special preparation and printing, and invariably presenting some
difficulty when the great question of head-dress had to be answered
becomingly. It is not easy to convey a Marconi system as a hat, nor
can it be considered a simple task to invest a coiffure elegantly with
the best principles of an air-ship, even though the ladies of long ago
saw fit to crown themselves with the last cry in Armadas. It is on
record that the audacious actor, Samuel Foote, distinguished himself by
appearing at a masquerade in an abnormally exaggerated caricature of
this fashion&mdash;a policy which led more directly to the discomfiture
of Samuel Foote than to any serious contempt for the fashions he held
up to ridicule.</p>

<p>An easy and popular manner of solving the problem of what to wear
is to reproduce the dress which is being worn by the heroine of some
very favoured play. V√©ronique, in her pale-green silk and white muslin
draperies, was a recent opportunity much adopted, and for years no
fancy-dress ball was complete without at least three Kate Hardcastles,
while Juliets were to be found in every doorway, and a dancing Faust
would lack no choice of Margarets.</p>

<p>The Calico ball proclaims itself pre-eminently thrifty in its
intention, and remarkably pretty effects may be obtained with cotton
fabrics, if sufficient intelligence be used in the design of the
dresses. To achieve the effect of an "old print," white cr√™pe cotton
and pale blue sateen, with a straw bonnet banded with the blue and
a pink rose beneath, may be recommended as useful ingredients. The
"Marcus Stone" girl, as we familiarly call a maiden clad in white
muslin with a frilled fichu, is another heroine whose frock lends
itself readily to cheap material, and we have always at our disposal
the ever-popular red, white, and blue flag, yet bunting is not
the most comfortable of fabrics for the enthusiastic dancer. The
embodiment of the Seasons, although considerably hackneyed, may safely
be accomplished with cottons and muslins and swansdown, leaves, and
flowers; and a very effective dress is the Rainbow, in which rainbow
cr√™pe of Japanese manufacture is an ideal assistant.</p>

<p>Chiffon is indispensable to the success of many a frock. In a dress
which shall represent Smoke, for instance, the chiffon ought to be of a
dark-grey tone, and yards and yards should be wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
about the figure and the head, the sleeves being wing-shaped, the
stockings and shoes to match. "Flames" may also be embodied with
orange-red and yellow chiffon, draped round with liberality, it being
understood in both these cases that a thin, tightly-fitting petticoat
and under-bodice be supplied of pongee to match the chiffon.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>AN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PIERROT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A good idea for a fancy-dress ball, if not one based perhaps upon
the truest spirit of poetry, is "Greens"; chiffon or silk of many
shades of green, with a head-dress in the shape of a cabbage. Very
successful, though not inexpensive, is the Oyster dress, composed of
a very thin white satin lined with pink satin, adorned at discretion
with fringes of pearls, while a pink chiffon chemisette is gauged to
admiration upon the draped white satin bodice, and the coiffure of the
wearer is surmounted by a coronet of oyster shells set on a bandeau of
pale-pink chiffon, with a floating veil of a deeper pink.</p>

<p>The White Queen from <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
can be cheaply and sufficiently represented by a frock of white calico,
with the hooped skirt set in a succession of thickly padded rolls, the
hair net of white chenille, surmounted by a crown of white cardboard
painted with the title. Ingenious, but perhaps not very becoming, is
a dress of white linen, with a big clock painted in the middle of the
skirt, the hands pointing to, say, 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
with the obvious purpose of suggesting that the wearer is "Better
late than never." A character which never fails to attract at the gay
carnival is Mephistopheles, the feminine or masculine variety being
alike adopted with avidity, in bright red, feather in the cap, and
a little shoulder-cape, and spangles complete. A good costume for
a man is the Druid, when he can arrange voluminous white draperies
as he will, and take unto himself the liberty of the mistletoe
wreath. A popular habit prevails of embodying the names of certain
illustrated journals, and representing the titles of some books. Some
daring innovator suggests labelling himself as a Doctor, and vows he
represents the "Dark Lantern," and the principle opens up a large
field for selection. Why should not an ordinary evening-dress-coated
gentleman be labelled "The Sphinx's Lawyer," and "The Coming Race" be
expressed by the Oxford and Cambridge crews limned on satin; and "The
Imaginative Man" might have a pair of wings fixed to the shoulders of
his ordinary broadcloth, a sign that he imagines himself an angel. The
ground is fruitful of suggestion.</p>

<p>"Fancy me in fancy dress," sings some gay lady in some gay play, and
the notion is full of fascination, which may best be realised, not by
the borrowing of clothes, but by making them, plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>ning
them, inventing them, and, above all, wearing them with grace. We have
passed the days and nights when we yearned to represent some tragic
figure&mdash;when to appear as Marie Antoinette or Mary Queen of
Scots seemed the pinnacle of delight. Gone too are the times when the
representation of the lamp-shade would exhaust the inventive power of
the many, and fled are our desires to coquette as a Columbine or flit
as a fairy in white tulle.</p>

<p>In an assembly where none are masked, a masked girl may attract
conspicuous attention, a monk who never draws cowl from his face may
have a following of the curious; she who would dress as Money, in gold
or yellow satin, jingling with golden coins, may be assured that she
will be run after, and she who represents Cleopatra, or some other
Oriental queen, blazing with jewels, will not be allowed to sit in a
corner.</p>

<p>An audacious selection is the costume of the Wallflower in gold and
brown, which looks its best when made in chiffon and velvet.</p>

<p>As a rule, it must be admitted that the finest fancy dress looks
the best, and however charming may be the effects arrived at with
muslin, cotton, cr√™pe, and calico, she who stands out in the vast
crowd will be she who has the most magnificent clothes. The glories of
brocade and satin and velvet will always hold supreme sway, allied to
some distinctively grand head-dress elevated from the head on a frame
and banded with jewels, with a long diaphanous veil flowing into a
sumptuous length of train. The splendidly glorious is only rivalled by
the darkly mysterious, and the maiden of the Yashmak, if only she has
the liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
eye that speaks the flirtatious soul, and the veiled
Sorceress, if her wit be sufficient to carry the
situation, may be quite irresistible: for always the
unknown allures.</p>

</div>

<p>An idea which, to say the least of it, savours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
nothing of conceit is to select the costume of a South Sea Islander,
and it is one most easily contrived with a sateen foundation oversewn
with feathers, and surmounted by a head-dress of erect plumes disposed
in wild confusion above locks apparently uninfluenced by the persuasive
brush or comb. You can see the result pictured, and note the contrast
of the sleek knave of diamonds, whose dress should be expressed in red
and blue and white and yellow, with black silk stockings.</p>

<p>In deciding upon a costume for a fancy-dress ball, the first thought
of the reveller should be to secure the becoming and the suitable, and
to be successful the choice should be mainly influenced by his or her
personality. I quite realise the problem to be a difficult one, since
happily we have not the gift given to us to see ourselves as others see
us, else should we never meet a podgy Mephistopheles bulging out of his
clothes, nor an attenuated Juno, nor a dusky Desdemona, nor a buxom
Puck.</p>

<p>Most artistic and felicitous results may be obtained from copying
costumes in old pictures; and visits to the National Gallery, and an
afternoon spent at the Wallace Collection, will prove themselves at
once a profit and a pleasure, and an easy guide towards the selection
of the appropriate dress. It is advisable on such occasions to be
accompanied by the kind friend who, without fear to risk a reproach,
will counsel with all wisdom, and temper your ambitions to your
personality.</p>

<p>An admirable item in the programme of the fancy-dress ball is the
quadrille, the lancers, or the cotillon, which shall be danced by
people clad in costumes of the same period, such harmony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
being a special pleasure to the beholder, who may nevertheless also
glean some entertainment from the spectacle of the nineteenth-century
Columbine hobnobbing with the fourteenth-century monk; and may no doubt
get some satisfaction from the sight of Cleopatra in the arms of the
Devil.</p>

<p>But I will linger no longer lightly in the realms of fancy dress,
but penetrate the dark depths of Dominoes and Masks, leaving the many
illustrations in these pages culled from the centuries to speak the
last word of selection with most fluent and expressive tongue.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="p5">OF DOMINOES AND MASKS</p>


<p>Italian in conception, the domino is of ecclesiastical origin, and
as such has retained its monkish aspect throughout the many changes
rung by fashion. In its primitive form it consisted of a long, loose
robe of black material with a cowl attachment which completely covered
the head. During the middle ages, and, in fact, as late as the
sixteenth century, it constituted the popular travelling costume of
those engaged upon secret missions. Disguised in the habit common to
the countless hordes of monks and other pious mendicants who infested
the country, it was an easy matter to go, unnoticed, from end to end of
Europe, the garb protecting its wearer and ensuring him immunity from
criticism or inquiry.</p>

<p>Its serviceable shape and virtue of concealment led to the universal
adoption of the domino, until it actually became as much an institution
as the toga of ancient Rome. Clad in its all-enveloping folds, the
hood drawn well forward and the face masked, the domino formed an
ideal dress for intrigue, love adventures, conspiracy, ball, rout,
procession, and evening wear in general over a gala<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
costume. It owed its first entry into <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le monde o√π
l'on s'amuse</i> to those Venetian orgies and wild midnight revels
encouraged by the Council of Ten as a means whereby the attention and
energies of the youth of the capital of the Adriatic might be diverted
from politics.</p>

<p>When the gay world made the domino its own, fashion decreed that it
should retain its original shape, and this it has continued to do down
to the present. The same conservatism did not extend to colour. As a
matter of fact it has, at one time and another, appeared in all shades,
and in every appropriate variety of texture, lined or unlined; in two
or more tones, self-coloured, trimmed, or plain, sumptuous or severe,
according to the tastes and inclination of the wearer. A man's domino,
as typical of to-day as of five hundred years ago, consists of a long,
ample robe of scarlet cashmere gathered into a plain yoke piped with
satin. Three small cashmere buttons fasten it snugly from the throat
downwards, and satin ribbon ties it across the chest. The peaked hood
is lined with satin and weighted with a heavy silk tassel, and over the
shoulders falls a short, pleated cape. Of the "angel" order, the wide,
pointed sleeves are turned back to allow a narrow glimpse of satin, the
fold held in place by a cord loop and a diminutive gold button sewn
to the under arm seam immediately above the wrist. That the religious
origin of the domino was never lost sight of is illustrated by the
anecdote of the dissipated young reveller who, leaving a masked ball in
the grey dawn, was met by an indignant father, who proceeded to load
him with reproaches on the subject of his dissolute mode of life. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
listening for some time in filial silence, the son
made the witty answer:</p>

<p class="center">Beati qui moriuntur in Domino.</p>

<p>From Italy the fashion of wearing dominoes spread to France, and
thence to England. In Paris the vogue reached its height under Louis
XIII. and Louis XIV. During the reigns of both monarchs, and more
especially the latter, masquerades and masked balls were the favourite
amusements of the Court. Many entertainments were given at which
dominoes were compulsory for men, the King alone being exempt from
this rule. Louis XIV. generally elected to appear in a white domino of
transparent muslin which merely veiled, without in any way concealing,
the gala dress beneath. Dominoes at this period were richly trimmed,
and contrived from costly materials.</p>

<p>Under the Regency masked balls were instituted at the Opera. At
these public functions, safeguarded by the practically impenetrable
disguise of a domino, all classes of society mixed indiscriminately.
If tales of the time are to be believed, many a gallant has shadowed
a domino the entire evening, only to make the humiliating discovery
that the coquettish countess of his dreams was a tripe-seller from the
market.</p>

<p>With the fall of the French monarchy the domino degenerated into
an abuse, and was finally abolished, excepting for such occasions as
carnivals and fancy-dress balls.</p>

<p>The dominoes worn by women differ from those worn by men in that
they invariably manage to strike a distinguishing feminine note. The
textures employed are lighter, being usually soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
satin, silk, or mousseline de soie. The hood, instead of partaking
of the severity of a cowl, is round in shape and, for most festive
occasions, is trimmed with fluffy frills of silk, chiffon, and lace,
further elaboration consisting of flowers. A characteristic example is
of forget-me-not-hued bengaline lined with pale pink. The yoke sparkles
with silver sequins and the round hood and shallow cape display frills
powdered with glittering paillettes, and reveal inner frills of frayed
pink silk and cobwebby lace the tint of old ivory, a bunch of shaded
roses being fastened near the left temple and another at the throat. At
the foot is a flounce which, when the wearer walks, shows occasional
glimpses of pink silk and cream lace, and the wide sleeves bear
sequin-embroidered cuffs and lace ruffles. A quaint domino is of gauze
of an opaque whiteness, strewn with black and gold spots of varying
sizes, the hood gathered up in the middle beneath a big white poppy,
the petals tipped with gold and the centre of black silk.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, many dominoes, both for men and women, were
made reversible. Occasionally, in addition to the hood, a towering
erection was worn on the head, causing the wearer to appear of
supernatural height, and the more mysterious. And I pause here to
observe with emphasis that at a masked ball a domino is invested with
special interest when surmounted by a fantastic headgear, and that such
an incongruous alliance as that of a white-powdered and curled wig
and the black silk domino shaped as a gaberdine, with a full hood and
lace-frilled silk mask, creates an effect beneath which an identity may
be most easily concealed. Far more desirable, however, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the interests of the beautiful, is it to select the domino and
head-dress in sympathy; and I may quote as a successful blend a long
cloak of jet-spangled net, with jet-spangled hood falling round the
shoulders, and a high-pointed head-dress of the fourteenth century,
with a pendent jet veil and a jet mask to cover the face, the chin
being held by a few folds of net to match the veil. Dominoes made
of net oversewn with petals of flowers, the hoods adorned to match
and well drawn over the hair, and the masks of lace in butterfly
shape, may also be quoted as decorative; and so too may the domino of
accordion-pleated silk, but custom has somewhat staled the charms of
this, and I would vote rather for the more sumptuous brocade, and urge
the importance of liberality in its folds.</p>

<p>The mask has, at all times, been the essential complement of the
domino. In its ordinary form it consists of a stiff shape arranged
to fit the face as far as the upper lip. Moulded to the nose, it is
provided with slits for the eyes and nostrils, and fastened by means
of a button and a narrow elastic band. Now and then it is edged with
a frill of lace which conceals the chin and further enhances the
disguise. Black satin and velvet are most frequently employed to cover
this kind of mask, the latter, by the way, being far more becoming;
but the black lace mask is an innovation of modern times, sometimes
failing in its purpose of disguise, and the chiffon spangled mask may
be accredited with like disadvantage. Coloured masks, or <em>loups</em>, as
they are termed in French, are also worn, but have little to commend
them, being grotesque and ugly.</p>

<p>Authorities differ concerning the origin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
masks. The most generally accepted theory is that they were first
employed at the festivals of Bacchus, and recent discoveries have
proved them to have been in use in ancient Egypt, numerous specimens
having been found at the heads of mummy-cases. These early examples are
composed of a substance closely resembling papier-mach√©, and painted in
imitation of life.</p>

<p>It was in Greece, however, that the mask reached its apotheosis.
There it formed an indispensable factor in classic drama. Its
introduction on the stage is attributed to Thespis, who is held to have
substituted masks for cosmetics.</p>

<p>There is no confusing the mask peculiar to the Greek theatre with
that of any other country or period. The industry rose to the dignity
of an art, as the beauty-loving Hellenes would tolerate nothing ugly or
ill-made on their actors.</p>

<p>The dramatic masks consisted of an entire head, with hair, beard,
and ornaments arranged in exact accordance with the character to
be portrayed. All the features were strongly accentuated, vividly
coloured, and of supernatural size. The eyes were deeply sunken, the
nose exaggerated, and the mouth open. Inside the parted lips was a
metal construction designed to make the voice carry a considerable
distance&mdash;a necessary measure, as all performances took place in
colossal open-air buildings. The moment an actor appeared upon the
scene a glance at his mask sufficed to determine the r√¥le he was about
to play; and, whether masculine or feminine, the details were equally
exact.</p>

<p>How comprehensive the range of selection was may be gathered from
the fact that masks were broadly divided into three great classes, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Tragical, Comical, Satirical, each of which was in turn subdivided as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Eight masks of old men, typifying differences of age, rank,
humour, etc.</p>

<p>2. A series of eleven masks of young men.</p>

<p>3. Seven varieties of masks of slaves.</p>

<p>4. Eighteen masks of women.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the masks depicting gods and heroes were
placed in a separate category. These never varied, and each displayed
the attributes of the deity portrayed. Thus Act√¶on appeared with the
antlers of a deer, Argus with a hundred eyes, Diana with a crescent;
and so on.</p>

<p>The earliest masks were fashioned from wood fibre, which in due time
gave place to leather, and finally to wax.</p>

<p>In Rome the art of mask-making was further elaborated. Trades and
professions were distinctively personated. Double-faced masks were
introduced, one side representing laughter and the other tears, so that
by turning his right or left profile to the audience, the actor could
change his expression at will.</p>

<p>Among the Romans the use of the mask was not restricted to the
theatre. It was worn in processions, and at certain festivals, notably
those dedicated to Pan, where masks of vine leaves were customary. A
strange funeral rite consisted of a performance given by a comedian
wearing a mask made in the likeness of the defunct. This mummer's
mission was to follow the coffin, acting and reciting the salient
features of the dead man's career, impartially setting forth both the
good and the bad.</p>

<p>In the reign of Augustus, patrician ladies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in the habit, when indoors, of wearing masks delicately perfumed and
treated with cosmetics. This fashion was revived by Henry III. of
France and his courtiers for the preservation of the complexion.</p>

<p>The fall of the Roman Empire marked the disappearance of the mask
from the stage. From then onward it appeared only in pantomime, where
the mask of Punchinello is familiar to this day. The nutcracker
countenance, with its highly-coloured cheeks and tinkling bells, is
a survival of extreme antiquity. I pause to wonder who the old Greek
may have been whom the maker of masks thus immortalised? There is a
world of cynicism, pathos, and philosophy in his face. I feel that he
sorrowed, and that it was not because he knew too little, but because
he knew too much.</p>

<p>The practice of wearing masks, by private individuals in everyday
life, started, as did the fashion for dominoes, in Venice. There the
black satin and velvet masks, still worn at fancy-dress balls and
during Carnival time, first obtained, to be enthusiastically adopted in
France and England a little later on. In the latter country, however,
the use of the mask never degenerated into an abuse as in France,
although masks became so fashionable in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, that society ladies deemed them an essential accessory to
the toilette. They were not always worn: sometimes they were carried
in the hand and held up to the face only when necessary. The exclusive
elected to appear masked at the theatre and other public places.</p>

<p>But the universal wearing of masks became
such a public menace and incentive to crime that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in 1535 an edict was issued in France prohibiting the fashion excepting
during Carnival time. Under Henry IV. the privilege was restricted to
the nobility, and it was made a capital crime for any commoner to don a
mask.</p>

<p>With Louis XIII. the mask fell into temporary abeyance, only to be
revived with renewed vigour under his successor. The first occasion
upon which Louis XIV. appeared in a mask was at the Palais Cardinal in
January 1656. From that date until January 1668 he was an enthusiastic
supporter of the vogue. The fashion, prevalent in 1650, of ladening
masks with superfluous trimming was of but short duration. While the
craze lasted a ruching of lace adorned the top, a lace frill the
bottom, and the eyes were encrusted with various decorations to such
an extent that ladies, descending from their carriages, were obliged
to be led, it being impossible for them to see. The preposterous vogue
inspired Scarron's ditty:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Dirai-je comment ces fantasques</div>
  <div class="i1">Qui portent dentelles √† leurs masques</div>
  <div class="i0">En chamarrent les trous des yeux</div>
  <div class="i1">Croyant que leur masque en est mieux.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Like its associate the domino, the mask gradually faded away with
the passing of the eighteenth century. In Italy it enjoyed the longest
and most undisputed sway. There it was worn by all members of the
community, including the clergy. The Council of Ten, the Inquisitors,
and the members of the Holy Office generally, both in Italy and Spain,
were closely masked when employed upon the exercise of their terrible
functions.</p>

<p>Certain unwritten but universal and indisput<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>able
laws rule the wearing of masks. Whether worn privately or in public,
its disguise has at all times and in all countries been respected
as inviolably sacred. To the masked the greatest extravagance of
language and gesture is permitted. He is allowed to indulge in acrid
personalities and proclaim scathing truths which, even if addressed
to the monarch himself, go unrebuked. To strike a mask is a serious
offence, while in no class of society, however degraded, would any one
dare to unmask a woman. Yet another prerogative entitles the masked
to invite any woman present, whether masked or not, to dance with
him, etiquette decreeing that the queen of the land may not claim
exemption from this rule. Dear to romance is the masked highwayman, who
flourished until the advent of railways robbed him of his occupation;
and a grim figure is ever the masked headsman.</p>

<p>Of numerous romances, none has equalled in fascination that of
the impenetrable mystery of le Masque de Fer. Held by many to have
been brother to Louis XIV., this strange prisoner of State guarded
his incognito to the end. He was never seen without a pliable steel
mask provided with a movable mouthpiece to allow of his eating with
comparative ease. Other peculiarities of his were his fondness for
exquisitely fine linen and his habit of invariably dressing in
brown.</p>

<p>No mode ever invented has appealed so strongly to the imagination,
or given rise to such tragedies and comedies, as that of the mask, and
no other has led its followers to such flights of folly. Nevertheless,
I find myself sighing for the days when it invested the neutral-tinted
world with the glamour of romance, twin sister of mystery, which was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
prevailing atmosphere when fashion decreed that men and women should
assume a common disguise and flit, shadow-like, among other nameless
shadows through the complicated mazes of their social highways and
byways.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="p5">OF MATERIALS, THE CORSET, AND THE CRINOLINE</p>


<p>The material question seems to have been answered
in every country save England, where the initiative
in manufacture is conspicuous by its absence,
though we have through the centuries so successfully
begged, borrowed, stolen, or acquired an
expert knowledge of the various textile arts, that
every manufactured fabric is now grist which may
come from our mill.</p>

<p>The art of cloth-making the early Britons
learned from the Romans, but their ambition towards
this industry died after the departure of their
instructors, not actively asserting itself again until,
at the suggestion of Philippa of Hainault, some
Flemish weavers established themselves at Norwich&mdash;a
policy evidently successful enough to induce
Edward III. in the fourteenth century to invite a
Flemish weaver to teach the art to "such of our
people as shall be inclined to learn it."</p>

<p>The trade was started at Kendal, spreading to
York and thence to many different towns, where
there grew up in due course the manufacture of
broadcloth, baizes, kerseys, and serges, the North
of England then, as to this day, holding the best
interests of the cloth trades firmly in the hollow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
its hand. It is interesting to note that an Act was
passed forbidding all save the King and Queen and
her children to wear any cloth but that made in
England, for here we may trace surely the work
of the legitimate ancestor of our passionate protectionist,
Joseph Chamberlain.</p>

<p>But, after all, woollen cloth is dull stuff, and
the first on the list of fabrics aiming at the
beautiful is cloth of gold, which made its bid for
fame in the days of Richard II., whose patronage
of the luxury was, however, mild in comparison
with that of that past master in the art of prodigality,
Henry VIII., who is said to have had as
many as twenty-five suits of cloth of gold, securing
it at a price of 40s. per yard, which does not seem
a very extravagant sum to-day.</p>

<p>A textile used in England during the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries is imperial, wrought with
gold, and credited with being woven at the workshops
kept by the Byzantine Emperors; and gold
also gave its assistance to the making of a well-known
stuff in the Middle Ages christened baudekin,
which later came to be a term signifying any rich
silk. A variety of the cloth of gold was plunket
cloth of gold&mdash;plunket, however, being more
properly described as a coarse woollen cloth; yet
it is authentic that Richard III. had a gown lined
with this, and in revels held by Henry VIII. at
Greenwich it was registered that there were six
ladies in "crimosin plunket" embroidered with
gold and pearls, so that fashion seems to have
idealised the homely plunket, which in its original
state would have been more suitably classed with
home-spuns, burnet, russet, and frieze. In the
fourteenth century taffeta was introduced into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
England, and taffy was the name of a watered
edition of this, which we owe to the refugees,
who crowded here in their numbers, and made
us familiar with brocade amongst other novelties.
Satin was known in England as early as the
thirteenth century, having been imported into
Europe from China, but not achieving much popularity
owing to its exorbitant price, though later
Henry VIII. had a great predilection for it in red.
Amongst stuffs associated immortally with history
and romance are sackcloth and samite, and the
latter, besides bearing its fame down from biblical
days, has been credited with possessing every known
virtue that the textile is heir to; it was originally,
no doubt, a heavy silk material woven with a
thread of six fibres, and carrying thick upon its
surface most glossy honours. When Sir Launcelot
came to King Arthur, the poet says:</p>

<div class="container">

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it is in white we invariably picture it, yet
more constantly in olden days it was made in red.
Suffering much change in its orthography, it was
originally written "samits," later "samit," and finally
invested with the final "e," and yet while every
record grants it a silken surface, some German
scholar, owing to the circumstance that to this
day their word "samt" expresses velvet, is quite
convinced that the samit of old was of velvet
substance.</p>

<p>To China was accorded the privilege of persuading
us permanently of the charms of brocade and
velvet, and the descriptions of the medi√¶val velvets
suggest that this could have been no difficult task,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for they include diapered velvets, figured velvets,
changeable velvets, velvets figured with white, and
velvets worked upon gold, while the Genoese and
the French rivalled each other in the best manufacture
of these.</p>

<p>The making of linen has been traced back to
the early Egyptians, and the art was brought to
England by the Romans, but a very fine linen
dedicated to altar cloths and shirts in the middle
ages was first manufactured at Rennes in Brittany.
The English linen trade made no great stride until
the reign of Charles I., and lawn and cambric were
first greatly used in England in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>Fur as a trimming appears to have had no
popular existence previous to the thirteenth century,
but after the reign of Henry III. it bears its part
bravely in romance and chronicles, ermine being
pre-eminent together with a fur known as lettice,
which closely resembles it; there were lettice caps
worn by ladies in the reign of Elizabeth, who indeed
forbade their wear to any but "a gentlewoman born,
having arms," and sable was permitted only to the
nobility and to certain officers of the Royal household
in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Lace has paid for its success in a disputed
birthplace, for both Flanders and Italy claim its
first manufacture, the experts declaring in favour
of the latter, and asserting that Italy bore the art to
Spain and passed it on to Flanders. In any case
Venice must be granted the first prize for the
beauty of its lace, which in early days was enriched
with gold and silver. Caen is accorded the honour
of having first introduced blonde lace, while France
and Switzerland and Belgium have all contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
their share towards the perfecting of "the most
fascinating of all fabrics," and different events of
history have brought no small influence to bear on
the popularity of different laces in different periods,
the foreign-made bone-lace obtaining the distinction
of being banished from England by royal order. In
the reigns of the Stuarts, lace adorned alike feminine
and masculine attire, and the collar of the luckless
King Charles I. in his many pictures by Vandyke
has stamped the fact indelibly on our minds. The
Commonwealth greatly affected the manufacture of
lace in England, though some of the most rigid
Puritans continued to wear Flanders lace, and the
dead body of the Protector was "robed in purple
velvet, ermine, and richest Flanders lace"&mdash;not so
bad for the simple cerements of the greatest socialist
who ever lived! The passion for wearing lace
reached its height in England in the reign of
William and Mary, when lace was indispensable
to the most exalted wearers of the commodes, and
its influence was essential on the full cravats and
ruffles. In the reigns of George I. and George II.,
Brussels lace grew especially popular; but English
lace reached a pitch of perfection at this period,
Devonshire being especially famous for the industry.
In its delicate meshes lace has held captive to its
charms many earnest students who have set down
its biography in various volumes, and to skim
these hurriedly is to do them wrong; so in passing
I would recommend their pages to the leisured,
while chronicling that we have known lace needle-run
or pillow-made for nearly four centuries, and
that it was preceded by the "cut out," the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">appliqu√©</i>,
and an embroidery worked in stiffly conventional
design on net with cords of thread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The most faithful and punctilious arch√¶ologists
confess that the origin of the corset must be written
down to the credit or discredit of man, for they
find the birth of its existence may be dated in the
far antiquity, when the savage made his hunting
belt of leather stiffened with bone or hard stick
held with a thong of hide, and as decorative as
useful, since it was adorned with shells and quills
and served to hold the knife or quiver.</p>

<p>Ovid recommends the fair ones of his day to
wear those ingenious constructions which give lines
to the bust and all it lacks, while Homer describes
Juno as wearing a ceinture ornamented with a
thousand fringes, and we are, of course, convinced of
the fact that she borrowed from Venus a famous
cestus wherein were all the pains and penalties of
love.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans sternly opposed
the corset, and yet they yielded to the necessity
for bands and belts to support the bust, this band
being usually made of embroidered leather. There
is indisputable proof that in the earliest days of
civilisation there was in use a variety of contrivances
for the reduction of the feminine figure, and in a
most interesting chronicle I read that "Amongst
the works of art discovered amongst the ruins of
one of the mysterious forest cities in South America
is a bas-relief representing a female figure which, in
addition to a profusion of massive ornaments, wears
a complicated and elaborate waist bandage, which
by a system of circular and transverse folding and
looping confines the waist just below the ribs to
the hips." What could be more conclusive? Here
is obviously the ancestress of the straight-fronted
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sp√©cialit√©</i> corset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The origin of the word "stays" comes from
stay, to support; the term "corset" may have been
developed from "corps": the term "corse," however,
must not be confounded with it, and Planch√© considers
this should apply merely to the bodice of a
gown. The earliest method of making the stay
was with pieces of cane, and this may be compared
favourably with a variety obtaining as lately as in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This was made of
steel with broad pieces of steel shaped to the hips,
and clamped or hinged under each arm, being
straightly stiff at the top of the front and the back,
where it reached up to the shoulder-blades. These
frames, however, were not primarily used to reduce
the waist, for they were worn over a corset, so that
the dress might yield not to the weakness of a
single fold, and that the stomacher might present a
front of unruffled smoothness. A development of
this stay showed it curved at the top, front, and
back, somewhat in the outline of those we wear
now, but clamped together down the back, and
made of the stiffest of iron, and decorated with
countless meaningless-looking little holes and
apertures. This was the style adopted by
Catherine of Medici, which permitted her the
questionable joy of reducing her waist to thirteen
inches.</p>

<p>Christine of France, we are told by Jacob the
bibliophilist, wore a "justaucorps" embroidered in
gold and studded with precious stones; this was a
remarkable shape, not defining the waist at all, and
finished off with an indented basque.</p>

<p>The first mention of what may rightly be
termed the corset is at the end of the fourteenth
century, when the dresses cut low in the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
introduced by Isabella of Bavaria were responsible
for the innovation, and made popular the wearing
of the new garment, which was made in all kinds
of materials laced either at the front or at the back.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifteenth century the
basquine was adopted, a corset of stout linen
or cotton with a busk of wood or metal at the
front. Rabelais says, "The ladies at the Court
of Francis I. wore basquines, and a silk camlet
over their chemises," and it is needless to say that
they incurred the displeasure of the preachers of
the day; indeed Charles IX. and Henry III. issued
several stringent laws with regard to the corset,
being convinced that it was highly injurious to
the health of its wearers, and the corps piqu√©
which was worn in this reign was neither more
nor less than an instrument of torture, compressing
the body into a hard unyielding mould, the splinters
of wood often tearing the skin. Until the end of
the sixteenth century the tailor had the monopoly
of corset-making, and his methods seem to have
been anything but tender. It was in the seventeenth
century that Ben Jonson pathetically
complained</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">The whalebone man,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who quilts the bodies I have leave to span.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the reign of Louis XV. corsets were cut away
on the hips and laced at the back, the long busks
of wood or steel being only in the front; whalebone
was used to stiffen the corset, which was sometimes
made in two pieces and laced under the arms, and
it was invariably supplied with shoulder-straps,
and began in those days to take unto itself such
rich materials as brocade and satin embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in gold chenille or silk. The Directoire period
produced a classic zone worn outside the dress, a
mode that soon gave place to the boneless corset,
a fleeting fancy, for all costume worn in the time
of Louis XVI. owes its greatest charm to the stays,
the bodices being cut into long points and fitted
tightly from bust to waist. In some instances
these bodices were sewn on to the figure of the
wearer after the stays had been laced to their
extreme limit, and many of Hogarth's figures
prove the influence of the very stiff stay, the
figures being erect in an uncomfortable degree,
for it is impossible to imagine any human creature
achieving such excellence of carriage without
considerable support from without, and some inconvenience
from within.</p>

<p>In the later days of the eighteenth century
greater comfort was granted, when the short-waisted
dress prevailed, together with the most
laudable ambition to copy the flowing elegance
of the classic period. But the rule of ease did
not obtain long, and in the early times of the
nineteenth century the fashion of tight lacing was
revived with enthusiasm, stays being composed of
bars of iron and steel with the tops stiffly steeled
so that the shoulder-straps might be dispensed
with. Women suffered a craze for compression,
until the sixth decade of the nineteenth century,
when its influence was somewhat less essential by
reason of the ubiquity of the crinoline, which
gave a semblance of the small waist to the least
slender.</p>

<p>The crinoline boasts as its great-great-grand-mother
the farthingale or vertingale, which was
worn in France in the reign of Henry II., when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
it is described as a cage put on beneath the petticoat
to inflate it to extravagant extent. It was,
however, in the days of Elizabeth that the farthingale
reached its apogee, and according to Sir Roger
de Coverley made its wearers look as if they were
"standing in a drum." Early in Charles I.'s reign
it went out of fashion, and when Catherine of
Braganza and her Portuguese ladies wore it on
coming to London for her marriage with Charles
II., the anachronism attracted crowds of amused
spectators. The farthingale, in fact, had become
obsolete, to reappear, however, in the somewhat
more convenient form of the hooped petticoat
which swelled in the reign of Anne. The contour
of this was very slightly altered in the reign
of George I., the sides being more curved at the
front and the back, and the old shape of the
circular farthingale was preferred with the trainless
gown. 1796 is the date given when hoops were
discarded except at Court, and the real crinoline
made its appearance in 1854, the previous year
having witnessed the crinoline petticoat as an
ordinary adjunct to dress. The Empress Eug√©nie
pronounced in favour of the crinoline, and it
became the mode, remaining so for many years,
while those few who refused to give it patronage
gave hostages to fashion in the horsehair-stiffened
petticoat. The crinoline in those days was of the
skeleton kind and formed of hoops of steel held
together by perpendicular tapes, but it soon developed
into a petticoat of calico with the steels
running through it at intervals from hem to waist.
It is amongst the fashions over which even the
most pessimistic may hopefully write "Ichabod."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="p5">OF CEREMONIAL AND BRIDAL DRESS</p>


<p>The rules and regulations of ceremonial dress are
as exacting, if not as unalterable, as ever were
those of the Medes and Persians. Kings and
Emperors punctiliously observe the etiquette which
frames them, so that every royal meeting or
parting or festivity is attended in a carefully
prescribed garb, and the Master of the Royal
Wardrobe must be deeply and wisely versed in
the history of the nations, and worthy to take a
diploma in the first division of the Court of
Costume.</p>

<p>His Majesty the King has a lynx eye; no item
escapes his notice; and he gives as much attention
to the details of everyday garb as to those of
clothes for merry or solemn occasion. Unlike the
Queen, he rules the fashions, and his wearing of
a low hat or a high hat, in white or in brown, a
tweed suit or a frock-coat, white boots or black
ones, decides such question for the multitude when
attending inaugurations, race meetings, and other
social functions, and the Royal decisions are
heralded forth in the press for public guidance.</p>

<p>At the recent coronation there was much discussion
of the form and shape of the robes for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
ladies, and the King, anxious to conciliate the
strictest etiquette of yesterday with a nice sense
of the fashionable exigencies of to-day, concerned
himself with the shape of the bodice and trimming
of the train. The results we may all remember,
the deeply crimson velvet, the borders of
miniver, and the license of the jewelled stomacher
and the lace under-skirt; while the rank which is
but the guinea's stamp found expression in the
epaulette, the coronet, and the bars of fur. In
truth, the coronation robe, even under its improved
conditions, cannot conscientiously be described as
becoming or comfortable. The only virtue that
I can see in it is its ponderous simplicity, the
details of which I will give&mdash;for the benefit of a
future generation&mdash;in the pompous language of the
official proclamation.</p>

<p>The edict issued informed those immediately
concerned that "the robe or mantle of the Peers be
of crimson velvet edged with miniver, the cape
furred with miniver pure, and powdered with
bars or rows of ermine according to their degree,
viz.&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="The edict">

</table></div>

<p>"The said mantles or robes to be worn over the full
Court dress, uniforms, or regimentals.</p>

<p>"Their coronets to be of silver-gilt, the caps of
crimson velvet turned up with ermine, with a gold
tassel on the top, and no jewels or precious stones
are to be set or used in the coronets, or counterfeit
pearls instead of silver balls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"The coronet of a Baron to have on the circle
or rim six silver balls at equal distances.</p>

<p>"The coronet of a Viscount to have on the circle
sixteen silver balls.</p>

<p>"The coronet of an Earl to have on the circle
eight silver balls raised upon points, with gold strawberry
leaves between the points.</p>

<p>"The coronet of a Marquis to have on the circle
four gold strawberry leaves and four silver leaves
alternately, the latter a little raised or pointed above
the rim.</p>

<p>"The coronet of a Duke to have on the circle
eight gold strawberry leaves."</p>

<p>Similar instructions were forwarded to Peeresses,
who were informed that their coronets were to be
identical in all respects with those worn by their
husbands. With regard to the remaining items of
their toilet, the following is an extract from the Earl
Marshal's proclamation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are to give notice to all Peeresses who
attend at the Coronation of their Majesties that the
robes or mantles appertaining to their respective
ranks are to be worn over full Court dress.</p>

<p>"That the robe or mantle of a Baroness be of
crimson velvet, the cape whereof to be furred with
miniver pure and powdered with two bars or rows
of ermine (<i>i.e.</i> narrow pieces of black fur), the said
mantle to be edged round with miniver pure two
inches in breadth, and the train to be three feet on
the ground.</p>

<p>"That the robe or mantle of a Viscountess be like
that of a Baroness, only the cape powdered with
two rows and a half of ermine, the edging of the
mantle two inches as before, and the train a yard
and a quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"That the robe or mantle of a Countess be as
before, only the cape powdered with three rows
of ermine, the edging three inches in breadth, and
the train a yard and a half.</p>

<p>"That the robe or mantle of a Marchioness
be as before, only the cape powdered with three
rows and a half of ermine, the edging four inches
in breadth, the train a yard and three-quarters.</p>

<p>"That the robe or mantle of a Duchess be the
same as before, only the cape powdered with four
rows of ermine, the edging four inches and a half
in breadth, the train four yards."</p>

<p>A note is added still further assisting the exact
interpretation of the Earl Marshal's instructions:</p>

<p>"It is understood that the above orders refer to
all English, Scotch, and Irish Peers (except Peers
who are minors, and Irish Peers who have seats in
the House of Commons)."</p>

<p>"Peeresses in their own right, the widows of
Peers, and the wives of living Peers, including the
wives of Irish Peers who have seats in the House
of Commons. With respect to such Peeresses as
have remarried under the rank of the Peerage,
they, according to former precedent, are not
considered as entitled to such summons." (A
summons to attend the Coronation.) "As to
widows of Peers who have remarried with a Peer
of lower degree, their precedence is with that of
their late husband."</p>

<p>The dress regulations relating to others than
Peers and Peeresses ruled that gentlemen should
appear in full uniform or full Court dress; while
ladies were commanded to wear Court dress
without trains, and mourning was strictly prohibited.
Knights Grand Cross and Knights Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Commanders were instructed to present themselves
in the mantles and collars pertaining to their
various orders.</p>

<p>Such youths as were fortunate enough to receive
invitations to attend, were instructed to do so in a
black velvet costume, knickerbockers, black silk
stockings, shoes with steel buckles, and a Glengarry
cap of black velvet.</p>

<p>The two dominant figures in the great pageant
bore upon them a burden of crowns, and cloaks,
and swords, and trains, palls, sceptres, and rings
and rods, mantles and caps and robes, whose heavy
cares represented but lightly Royal responsibility.</p>

<p>But the most interesting of all the garbs of
convention, because the most supremely personal,
is the bridal costume, dedicated primarily to white,
and permitted to enjoy the distinctions of silver
or lace decoration.</p>

<p>Under ordinary conditions the widow who remarries,
even as the mother of a bride, finds herself
tempted to the paths of grey, and only occasionally
lapses into the more triumphant glories of violet
and pale blue and cream colour; and with the
present fashion of enshrouding the hat or toque
with a pendent veil, she may confidently share the
grace of drapery with the virgin bride. Now and
again during the past and the present centuries
brides have thought fit to indulge their white satin
simplicity with embroidery outlined with gold
threads, and some have been sufficiently audacious
to introduce a yellow-petalled daisy; and the revival
of an old custom is the substitution of the prayer-book
for the bouquet. But these are trivialities
which obtain but scant attention, not even reaching
the importance of a nine-days' wonder. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
whole, the bride's dress in the civilised parts of
Europe must be written down as pre-eminently
conservative and "splendidly null," and it is
interesting to turn from its monotony to a consideration
of the ordinary bridal costume in √Ügra.
This is black, and round the forehead of the bride
is bound a fillet of pendent jewels in the shape of
tears. And, by the way, I find that an embroidered
pattern of tears was selected to ornament a widow's
grey cloak in the sixteenth century. Assuredly this
is a poetic notion, but its realisation might prove
a little embarrassing, if the grief for the departed
subsided before the garment was worn out. There
would be nothing for it, I suppose, but to dedicate
it to private service as a house-gown, or to give
it the obscurity which a petticoat enjoys. When
the sorrow dwindled to extinction, the remnants of
the garment might well be bestowed on some very
poor widow whose woe, mitigated or not, would
inevitably rejoice at the chance of such elegant
proclamation. But to return to my bride of √Ügra,
who enters upon her duties with much gravity and
solemnity, going to the altar in a short black skirt,
laced bodice, and hooded cloak, her sole ornament
the nuptial band, which is bound round her forehead
and tied with ribbon at the back, while in
her hands she carries her rosary and her veil.</p>

<p>In Switzerland black is allowed on festival
garb, and on Sundays the women wear black in
the mornings and change to colours in the evening.
In the Berne Canton the women usually display a
black lace cap, shaped like a fan and tied under the
chin, accompanying this with long green gloves;
and in everyday life their costume comprises a
blue or black petticoat reaching to the ankles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
scolloped at the border with red or white, completed
with a white chemisette high to the throat,
with full short sleeves revealed beneath a short
sleeveless jacket. On their heads are straw hats,
and on their legs and feet red stockings with
black clocks and heel-less shoes, and their hair
is worn hanging down in two long plaits.</p>

<p>Costume has through the ages been allowed
to signify the married or unmarried state of its
wearer. In Rome the purple-bordered toga and
the segmentum&mdash;concerning which there has been
some discussion, since it has been separately described
as a necklace, a fringe, and an embroidered
ribbon&mdash;would grace the matron. The Roman
bride wore a red veil or flamen on her wedding-day;
and in Greece the married woman parted
her hair in front in a different fashion from that
of the maids; and to this day in some parts of
the Grecian Islands brides wear the flame-coloured
veil, and follow the custom of putting a patch of
gold-leaf on the face. The modern bride of Corfu
illustrated at page 126 is wearing a skirt of purple
and an apron of blue, and a short blue corselet
buckled with gold; her small red velvet coat is
traced with gold, and gold ornaments hang round
her neck and hold the white chemisette across
the bust. Ribbons entwine her hair with garlands
of flowers, and over these a soft white veil hangs
to the waist, ribbons again fluttering their elegance
from waist to hem.</p>

<p>In various parts of Italy the peasants have
ornaments handed down from generation to
generation, and as a present to each succeeding
bride an extra chain or jewel is added, forming
a sentimental record of lineage which only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
most devastating poverty induces the possessor to
part with.</p>

<p>The practice of weaving a wedding-veil is an
old one, dating from the times of ancient Greece.
A bride of Attica is immortalised in a long flowing
robe of clinging rose colour, with a girdle of
gold cord knotted and tasselled. Her hair is
closely curled round the nape of her neck, and
drawn up at the back into a wide meshed net,
the front banded with a golden fillet engraved
with a Grecian key pattern, whence floats a
transparent white veil to the ground.</p>

<p>The donning of a bridal crown is a fashion
which traces its origin to the far North, and in
Scandinavia it is the most significant feature of
the bridal attire, each parish being possessed of its
special crown, the property of the church, the
pastor of which sanctions the use of the crown
only when the bride is of irreproachable character.
Such a custom should act as a powerful incentive
to virtue, since to stand before the altar uncrowned
must be conclusive evidence of unworthiness.</p>

<p>Of copper-gilt, the bridal crown differs slightly
according to the district. In the diocese of
Drontheim it is round in shape, tapering up to
spire-like points, the rim encircled with a double
garland of flowers emblematic of innocence, while
from beneath it at either side dangle streamers of
gaily coloured ribbon and black lace over luxuriant
tresses, real or false, either of hair or straw.
The dress consists of a close-fitting bodice with
long tight sleeves, and a plain skirt to the ankles,
of the same dark material, the short narrow apron
being of white muslin. The corsage is almost
hidden beneath a pelerine made of wool covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with white lace, edged with green ribbon, and
decked across the chest with a triangular piece
of scarlet cloth, which forms the resting-place for
lavish adornment with gold and silver ornaments
connected by chains; the narrow belt is of scarlet
cloth, and falls in a single end down the left side
of the front. The hands are held in a little drum-shaped
muff of red cloth, bordered by lines of green
silk and lace and further decorated with brooches;
and on the feet are dark stockings and black leather
shoes with imposing silver buckles.</p>

<p>The costumes and customs of Sweden and
Norway have always borne a certain family resemblance;
in both countries the crown plays a
prominent part at weddings, occasionally assuming
proportions more fantastic than convenient. In
Hardanger the crown is a very gorgeous affair,
large and wide at the top, set with rubies and
emeralds and quivering with pendent ornaments;
and beneath it the hair is divided to hang down
loosely from a shower of bright ribbons. The
scarlet skirt is trimmed with black velvet, and
the white apron has a band of drawn thread-work
at the hem, the bodice revealing a plastron made
of a variety of coloured cloths, with red for the
predominant hue, covered with gold and silver
jewellery of the filigree description. Tradition
orders that the bride shall retain her finery intact
for an entire week, during which period the
wedding festivities are kept up with unflagging
enthusiasm, and on the eighth day she gives the
signal for the merrymaking to cease by raising her
hand to press a secret spring, when the heavy
crown falls from her head and leaves her free to
join in the last joyous dance with her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Possibly the annals of costume contain no more
extravagant wedding-dress than that peculiar to
the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg. The bridal crown
is certainly unique. It is made of little quadrangular
pieces of metal which display a raised
design and are mounted upon a high cylindrical
shape of pasteboard encircled by a fringe of gilt
leaves attached to silver buttons. These buttons
head a band of red velvet ribbon tied in a huge
bow behind, where a curved handle of twisted
green velvet extends itself with wide ends of green
velvet ribbon that conceal the ears and are tied
in an enormous bow under the chin above a stiff
gigantic bow of black silk. The tight short skirt
is of dark wool with a scolloped border of red and
yellow, and a narrow pleated apron is in a dull
shade of tangerine. About the waist is a broad
sash of black silk tied in a monster bow in the
front, and the tight bodice introduces the multi-coloured
vest. Little can be seen of the bride or
her gown beyond the Brobdingnagian bows, and her
costume might be thought to embody the axiom&mdash;it
is well to have more than one bow to your
string.</p>

<p>The peasantry of the Swiss canton of Fribourg
hold reverently to ancestral tradition, wearing the
dress of their grandparents in token of their
resolve to remain faithful to ancient custom. The
bride plaits her hair in a single plait under an
erection like the hussar's cap, made in pale blue
trimmed with narrow lines of rose silk ruching,
and banded across the forehead with black velvet.
Her stockings, short skirt, and bodice are of scarlet,
the sleeves terminating with velvet cuffs, and her
apron is of black or of silk of some sombre shade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
The indispensable plastron-vest is of pink edged
with silver lace and loaded with silver buttons, and
the flat circular ruffle is of pale blue edged with
silver braid; and below it hangs a fine silver chain
supporting a large medallion.</p>

<p>Mystic in its simple grandeur is the dress of
an Armenian bride, consisting of a long trailing
gown of thick silk, richly interwoven with gold,
held at the waist by a golden girdle, and opening
down the front to show a petticoat of a contrasting
colour. On the head is a wreath of white flowers,
overspread by a veil of misty white, which falls
to the ground above a shower of glittering gold
streamers.</p>

<p>The early fashions of Egypt in gala times,
although sufficiently decorative in their colour and
drapery, were always spoilt by the hideous head-dress
of black wool or hair tied with wool and
plaited, or set out aggressively at either side like
a furze bush in mourning. On state occasions the
Egyptian woman wore a dress with full sleeves of
silk checked in crimson and yellow. The hem
was trimmed with a gold fringe, and round the
waist was a wide girdle, and on the feet leather
shoes embroidered in gold. The black plaits as
well as the head were adorned with gold braid
encrusted with precious stones; a blue lotus flower
fell over the forehead, a number of gold bodkins
were placed above the fillet, and large gold hoops
hung from the ears. Bracelets and necklets
formed of rows of enamelled discs, pearls, strings
of lizards and beetles of stamped gold, all served
at feasts to adorn the Egyptian beauty, whose
favourite bangle was in the form of a snake, and
whose fingers were stiff with rings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>An old Indian festival dress is emblazoned with
beads and silks in gay colours, and bears long
square lappets hanging from a jewelled headpiece.
The sombre tunic is enriched with jewels at the
neck and waist. Remarkable specimens of old
Indian taste and ingenuity are the tunics made of
leather thickly encrusted with beads of different
colours in geometrical pattern, such tunics being
fringed with leather and completed by a much
feathered head-dress.</p>

<p>Byron's verse gives a haunting picture of
Moorish magnificence, when he describes Haid√©e
in her joy:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Around, as Princess of her father's land,</div>
  <div class="i0">A like gold bar above her instep rolled</div>
  <div class="i0">Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;</div>
  <div class="i0">Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold</div>
  <div class="i0">Below her breast was fastened with a band</div>
  <div class="i0">Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;</div>
  <div class="i0">Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd</div>
  <div class="i0">About the prettiest ankle in the world.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Bokhara the bride wears a rose-coloured veil
on her wedding-day; and here, strangely enough,
deep blue is the distinctive mourning colour.</p>

<p>The costume of married women in Afghanistan
must be granted much admiration: they wear a
shirt with wide sleeves embroidered with flowers
in coloured silks, coloured trousers, and a small
cap embroidered in gold threads, and over this, at
the approach of a stranger, they throw a large
sheet. Beneath the cap the hair is divided into
two plaits on either side and fastened at the back.
Chains, nose and ear rings are selected at discretion;
and the unmarried women are known by their white
trousers and loosely flowing hair.</p>

<p>Returning to Western climes, I note that Isabella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Queen of Richard II. of England, included in her
trousseau a gorgeous and unique robe and mantle
of red grained velvet, embroidered with metal birds
of goldsmith's work perched upon branches of
pearls and green precious stones. Obviously economy
was no object, and her Majesty had determined to
do the thing handsomely.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century English matrons wore
a coif or close bonnet, and the unmarried women
braided their hair with knots of ribbon. There
is a curious record in the history of Chester in
Henry VIII.'s time, which includes an order "to
distinguish the head-dress of the married women
from unmarried, no unmarried woman to wear white
or other coloured caps; and no woman to wear any
hat, unless she rides or goes abroad into the country
(except sick or aged persons), on pain of 3s. 4d."
Such an order is almost as unreasonable as ungrammatical,
yet there is comfort to be gleaned from
the fact that the tax on disobedience was but
3s. 4d.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century in Scotland the hair of
an unmarried girl was bound by a snood or simple
fillet, a lock of hair hanging on each side of the face
and tied with a ribbon; but, when married, women
covered the hair with a fold of linen fastened under
the chin and falling in points on the shoulders.</p>

<p>At the marriage of Princess Elizabeth, daughter
of James I., in 1613, when the fashion of the time
was the stiff stomacher, farthingale and ruff, "the
bride wore a crown set with diamonds, a dress
of silver stuff embroidered with silver, pearls and
precious stones, the train so long that it was borne
by twelve or fifteen fair young ladies, the hair flowing
freely down as low as the knee, in the style that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
virgins used to wear their hair at their weddings."
After dinner the Princess put on a dress embroidered
with gold, and did up her hair.</p>

<p>This description of a Venetian wedding in the
eighteenth century was by Lady Miller:&mdash;"All
the ladies, except the bride, were dressed in
their black gowns with large hoops; the gowns
were straight-bodied with very long trains, the
trains tucked up on one side of the hoop with
a prodigious large tassel of diamonds. Their
sleeves were covered up to their shoulders with
falls of the finest Brussels lace, a drawn tucker of
the same round the bosom, adorned with rows of
the finest pearls, each the size of a gooseberry, till
the rows descended below the top of the stomacher;
then two rows of pearls, which came from the back
of the neck, were caught up at the left side of the
stomacher, and finished in two fine tassels. Their
heads were dressed prodigiously high, in a vast
number of buckles and two long drop curls in the
neck. A great number of diamond pins and strings
of pearls adorned their heads, with large sultanas,
or feathers, on one side, and magnificent diamond
ear-rings. The bride was dressed in cloth of silver
made in the same fashion, and decorated in the same
manner, but her brow was kept quite bare, and she
had a fine diamond necklace and an enormous
bouquet."</p>

<p>Lady Miller deserved to have lived in times
when the conduct of the fashion paper was amongst
the privileges of the high nobility.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="p5">OF DANCING DRESSES, EUROPEAN AND ORIENTAL,
ANCIENT AND MODERN</p>


<p>Sympathy between Church and Stage is of no
novel date. The relationship between the two
has been close and intimate since the days when
no religious festival was complete without its
chorus of dancers, and the officiating priests took
part in the tripping until the introduction, in
the Middle Ages, of such profanities as the Dance
of Death and the Dance of the Angels, common
in Italy, Spain, and France, caused the practice to
fall into disrepute.</p>

<p>Possibly the present time sees the Terpsichorean
art at its lowest ebb. Nevertheless, a
promising sign of reviving interest is that modern
scientists, following the example of the old Greek
philosophers, are emerging as champions of the
lightsome measure. Still, it is doubtful whether
it will ever again attain the respect it reached in
ancient Greece; and it were mere optimism to hope
that we may yet witness Members of Parliament
dancing to their seats in the House of Commons,
our judges pirouetting solemnly towards the
bench, and our admirals and generals inculcating
a spirit of patriotism by dances devised to inspire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
heroic sentiments and an exalted idea of military
duty.</p>

<p>The ballet, an invention of the priesthood of
Egypt, was inaugurated in connection with certain
sacred festivals, notably those dedicated to the
bull Apis, and it formed an important feature
of the initiatory rites into the mysteries of Isis.
It was mystic rather than sensuous, and the aim of
its composer was to suggest the hidden things of
the cult, the course of the heavenly bodies, and
the harmony of the universe. The astronomical
dance was far from being the only one practised.
At Memphis and Thebes the priests danced round
the bull Apis; the figures in turn depicting the
miraculous birth of the god, the incidents of
his childhood, and his union with Isis. Finally,
on the occasion of his death, his obsequies were
celebrated with dances of appropriate solemnity.
But, alas! these capers were not concerned with
clothes, for the performers were unhampered by
sartorial considerations, and the toilet of a female
dancer consisted of a narrow metal girdle about
the hips, the deep circular collar peculiar to the
race, and a tambourine. Occasionally these items
were supplemented by a transparent robe of the
finest white muslin, and the arrangement of the
hair, or wig, was always elaborate. Framing the
face, it rested on either shoulder in a dense mass
of plaits, the back hanging in a straight line of
thick braids just below the nape of the neck,
while a gleaming metal fillet flashed low on the
forehead. Male dancers contented themselves with
serried skirts, in which they twirled with extended
arms, much after the manner of dervishes.</p>

</div>

<div class="larger-file">
  [<a href="images/i_226fpa.jpg">See larger version</a>]
</div>

<p>Descendants of these ancient ballerinas are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
be found in Egypt to-day in the persons of the
Ghawazees. In common with most Oriental
dancers, the Ghawazee takes up her position on
a brightly coloured carpet. She is dressed in a
sleeveless corselet, brilliantly enamelled after the
style of an Egyptian sword-sheath, her only other
article of attire being a simple muslin chemise
vividly spotted and star-bespangled, while on her
head a kerchief of cloth of gold is draped in
quaint manner. Her bare feet never move, the
body alone vibrating to the shrill music of flute
and cymbals. The play of the long supple arms
is wonderful as they in turn caress and pursue
an invisible being who eternally eludes their
passionate embrace.</p>

<p>To revert to the days when the Pyramids were
the newest thing in architecture, traces of the
sacred dance of Apis are found in Biblical history
where the prophets of Israel inaugurated the
habit of dancing round the golden calf; but
unfortunately the costume is omitted from the
records, and though I know Miriam led a procession,
dancing and playing on the tambourine,
and David danced before the Ark, and Jephthah's
daughter danced to her doom, their dress is
"enwrop in mystery"; and I can but hope it was
adequate.</p>

<p>The art of dancing was glorified into popularity
in Greece, where it was held in high veneration
and freely indulged in by all members of the
community, upon whom the exercise was rendered
incumbent up to the age of thirty. How salutary
a similar rule would be, if enforced in England
to-day! There would be no lack of dancing men
at balls, the task of the chaperone would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
lightened, and the burden of anxiety pressing upon
the much-harassed hostess reduced to a feather-weight.</p>

<p>The dances of the old Hellenes were divided
into three classes&mdash;the sacred, the military, and the
profane; and dress was endowed with a festive air
by the flowers and garlands of leaves worn on the
head. A chorus of female dancers, attired in
white, was a feature at funerals; while, clad in
full armour and equipped as though for the field
of battle, men practised the military dances with
vigour and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In ancient Rome the art of dancing, as learned
from the Greeks, degenerated into an excuse for
licentiousness, and wealthy patricians included
female dancers among their slaves. The dress of
these dancers was of transparent tissue held by
jewelled girdles, and flowers were in their hair
and fell in a wreath round their necks.</p>

<p>In India there are two classes of dancers&mdash;those
consecrated to the service of the pagodas, and those
known as Nautch girls, or to give them their
Portuguese title, Bayadeses. The former are termed
Devadasi, and are to be found in numbers in the
sacred city of Benares. The dress of the Nautch
girl is brightly coloured, of rich material brilliantly
decorated with embroidery and precious stones.
It comprises tight embroidered trousers to the
ankles, plainly visible through a short skirt of
transparent texture held at the waist by a girdle
from which hangs a narrow white muslin apron,
pleated and bordered with gold. The little chuli,
a diminutive jacket, is short-sleeved and cut low
at the throat, and leaves the centre of the body
bare but for a diaphanous scarf which floats from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the left shoulder, twines round the figure, and
escapes to flutter in a loose end behind. Glistening
with oil, the black hair is parted and hangs down
the back in a long plait, weighted with a cluster
of gold tassels. The tiny skull-cap is gaily
embroidered, and the scented petals of flowers
quiver amid the dark tresses. Bracelets load the
arms and legs, rings scintillate in the ears and on
the fingers and toes, chains dangle from the neck,
and an enormous ring depends from the left nostril.
During centuries the dances of the Devadasi and
Nautch girls have altered little, if at all, and it
would be amusing to contrast their methods with
the polychromatic lightsome modernity of Loie
Fuller, the abrupt conclusions of the "high-kicker,"
and the prim precisions of the pink-shod
pirouetter of the pantomime. Will the
Lord Chamberlain permit?</p>

<p>Like the Daimios and Samourai, the sacred
Geisha is rapidly becoming a memory only in the
Japan of to-day. Nevertheless, the custom of
keeping dancing girls in the temples still survives
in certain provinces. Quaint because of their
solemnity, the religious dances are executed by a
number of diminutive maidens under thirteen years
of age. Ranged on a platform, these odd little
vestals are garbed in a manner which adds considerably
to the bizarre effect of the scene. Each
wears twelve kimonos, one on top of the other,
alternately white and red, the borders showing in
regular rows at the throat, and over these is a
Court mantle sumptuously embroidered in gold
and coloured silks, the back shaped to suggest
a chasuble. Divided down the centre in front,
the hair hangs in a plait behind, decorated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
circles cut out of gold paper drawn together to
form two big rings, while at the temples appear
clusters of red camellias and wistaria and metal
ornaments. The face is whitened and the lips are
stained vermilion, and the shaved eyebrows replaced
by short, slanting lines of black paint, which lend
a touch at once piquant and grotesque. The
Geisha of the house is a vastly different person.
Her sole mission in life is to amuse and entertain.
To this end she dons a gaily-embroidered kimono
and decorates her black hair with fans, flowers,
and other ornaments. Her prettiest performance
is the fan dance, to the light strain of a stringed
instrument played by a female musician. Fluttering
a fan in her right hand, with her left she
liberates a paper butterfly, then, darting hither
and thither with marvellous grace and dexterity,
she pursues it as it floats towards a flower, skims
a petal and alights on the brim of a cup, to escape
afresh and describe moth-like circles about the
flame of a candle, suddenly disappearing in a quick
flash of fire.</p>

<p>In Mohammedan countries dancing is denounced
as a sin. Men never indulge in it, either
for profit or pastime, while such women as make
it their profession are regarded as disreputable
members of the community.</p>

<p>Despite the ban placed upon them, Persian
dancers are wonderfully skilful, and capable of
performing prodigies in their particular line. They
dance to the accompaniment of an air chanted by a
woman or a boy. The rhythm is slow, the tune
languorous, and the action pantomimic, being made
up of certain poses and movements which, seconded
by an eloquent play of feature, strive to tell a story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of some sort. The most popular and best known
is the Dance of the Bee. The dancer pretends to
have been stung, and pursues the insect with a
thousand graceful turns and bends, divesting herself
of her garments as she does so. She first appears
upon the scene in the all-enveloping mantle common
to her countrywomen out of doors. This removed,
she is seen to be wearing a short skirt, pulled well
down on the hips, a long-sleeved jacket of white
muslin, cut low at the neck and open nearly all the
way from the throat, and a little coat of brightly
coloured silk, satin, or velvet. Her hair hangs in
plaits, surmounted by a tiny embroidered cap perched
high on the head. Finally she discards both coat
and inner jacket, and reveals a body covered with
tattoo marks, huge serpents writhing about the legs,
and flowers, birds, and palms standing out prominently
on the white flesh. Her bust is supported
by round shields joined together in front and attached
by a narrow band behind, and in her hands she
manipulates a scarf with marvellous grace and
dexterity.</p>

<p>The costume of a Turkish dancer allows less
freedom of movement, being more cumbersome and
elaborate. The skirt reaches to the ankles, where
it terminates in a deep hem headed by a fringe,
and the little sleeveless jacket is fastened at the
throat only, and opens over a chemisette. About
the waist a fringed shawl is arranged in such a way
as to suggest a circular frill, while a belt, held by
a large clasp, is drawn low on the hips. A white
veil is thrown over the turban and pinned under the
chin with a jewelled brooch, concealing the hair
and ears but leaving the face exposed, and on the
feet are yellow slippers sewn with seed pearls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sword Dance of Bonnie Scotland has its
Oriental prototype in the Dance of the Scimitar.
The latter inspires a charming costume. A veil of
diaphanous gauze falls cloud-like over the hair and
face, and the white muslin chemisette, with its
sleeve to the elbow, is drawn in below the waist
with a coloured sash, a necklace composed of rows
of gilt coins glittering on the bare throat. The
ankle-length skirt is of heavier texture, draped with
a fringed shawl drawn round the hips, knotted in
front, and hanging in a point behind; while a
scimitar is balanced on the head, a second being
held in the right hand, the left resting lightly on
the hip.</p>

<p>Much as the mantilla makes for grace in Spanish
dances, I, personally, prefer the dress of the peasants.
In Galicia a rural dancer delights the eye in a
quaint hat shaped like a fool's cap, with the addition
of a three-cornered brim of black velvet turned
sharply up in front, one pompon adorning the
summit and another appearing midway down at
either side. A scarlet sash, with fringed ends, is
knotted carelessly on the right hip, and the long-sleeved
white shirt is thrown into striking relief
by a little sleeveless bolero of scarlet cloth, the back
bearing an embroidered design, the front conspicuous
for triangular pockets dedicated to castanets,
and small revers of black velvet. The tightly-fitting
knickerbockers are of tan leather, finished at
the knee with black bands, where they are met by
gaiters to match, closely buttoned up the outer
side. A female dancer is no less picturesque in a
short skirt of striped red and white, low black
shoes and white cotton stockings; her apron
displays a border of contrasting colour, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
chemisette is almost concealed by a short round
cape of cloth edged with black velvet, which
crosses over and fastens at the left side of the waist.
A gaily-patterned kerchief is worn on the hair, the
point falling beyond the shoulders behind.</p>

<p>Infinitely more showy is the dancing dress of a
professional, a member of a well-known troupe in
Seville. The yellow satin skirt, reaching below the
knees, is laden with glittering sequin trimming and
a shower of lace and chiffon flounces, and powdered
with spangles and small imitation coins. The low-necked
satin bodice has tight elbow-sleeves, softened
with lace frills, and from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d√©colletage</i> dangle
glittering paillettes, a cluster of flowers being
fastened at the left shoulder. The hair is elaborately
arranged, and a bunch of flowers peeps out at the
right side from under the folds of a mantilla. An
important part of the male dancer's dress is a
black toreador hat, with a large pompon in front.
Merely a glimpse is caught of a white shirt front,
and the long-sleeved satin or velvet jacket is
gorgeously embroidered at the wrists. Similar
embroidery shows down the outside of either
leg of the satin knickerbockers, which meet white
stockings accompanied by black ballet shoes. A
sash with fringed ends is knotted on one hip,
and a cloak is thrown with careless care over the
shoulders and wound in inimitable fashion round
the left arm.</p>

<p>The "Coon" dance so dear to the South American
makes no great demands upon the skill and ingenuity
of those entrusted with the planning of a
suitable costume. A short skirt of red and white
awning is the most usual, accompanied by a scarlet
sash knotted low on the left hip. The loose white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
blouse vaunts a sailor collar, turned-back cuffs, and
a cravat of striped material matching the skirt. Black
shoes and stockings are worn, and the large straw
hat is of the haymaker order, the crown encircled
by a red scarf tied at the left side with the ends
falling to the shoulder.</p>

<p>A costume appealing to the male dancer who
appreciates comfort is that of gay old Pierrot, with
his full white trousers and black pompons, loose
coat and ruffle, conical hat above a black silk scarf,
whitened face, and vermilion lips. His feminine
companion is a common object in the fancy-dress
ballrooms on and off the stage.</p>

<p>Practically every country has its characteristic
dances, to which are naturally dedicated some adaptation
of the national dress. There are fancy dances
in plenty which call for no distinctive style of dress,
but the fashion fits the footstep as a rule, and no
doubt influenced its birth. The stately movements
of the minuet and the grace of the gavotte
ask for the dignity of powder and brocade; the
country dance seems the merrier for the gaily-coloured
fluttering ribbons and short bright petticoats;
the hornpipe would lose some significance
without the co-operation of navy blue and a man-o'-war
or a Jack-tar hat; the hunting dance shouts
"away" for pink; the Irish jig is shorn of much
of its charm without the emerald-green skirt,
the scarlet cloak, and the folded kerchief; the
Scotch dance demands its tartan; the Spanish
dance the mantilla and castanets; and so on
through the whole dictionary of dances. The
mode suits the measure, and the dance destined
to be performed in clogs loses its individuality
when tripped in satin slippers; the tarantella could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
not live to tell its tale in sabots; the jig would
jump to a conclusion under the stultifying glories
of satin and patches; and the sensuous grace of
the East would expire in the bondage of Western
raiment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="p5">OF THEATRICAL DRESS</p>


<p>The time has long gone by when the dress of his
own period would serve the turn of the actor in
any character in any play, irrespective of the
century in which its story passed. That condition
of affairs has no place even in the mental treasure-trove
of the oldest playgoer, who saw Edmund
Kean, and never lets you forget it.</p>

<p>Although it has not been stated that the most
audacious actor ever ventured to play <cite>Hamlet</cite> in a
tall hat, solecisms no less grave have in the long
ago been committed and condoned, even applauded.
Imagine Othello addressing the "most potent,
grave, and reverend signiors" of sixteenth-century
Venice in a stiff-skirted coat, breeches and waistcoat
of the English fashion of George II.'s day, with
a full-bottomed wig, a three-cornered hat, and a
black face! Yet that was how Garrick dressed the
part, and, notwithstanding, thrilled his audience to
enthusiasm; whilst handsome Spranger Barry won
even Colley Cibber's applause when he acted the
dusky Moor dressed in a full suit of gold-laced
scarlet, a small cocked hat, knee breeches, and
silk stockings! Then, picture Macbeth, as Garrick
played him, in a 1750 suit of black silk, and silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
stockings and shoes, with buckles at his knees and
feet, and a tie wig, or in the scarlet and gold-laced
uniform of a British general of George III.'s reign!
And fancy Lady Macbeth in enormous hooped
petticoats and huge flounces, as Mrs. Yates dressed
her; yet, when she said, "Give me the daggers," and
took them in her hands, as an old print shows her
doing, no one in the audience recorded a thought
that the action was incongruous with the costume,
or the costume with the tragedy. What a contrast
to the superb green and gold glories of the costume
of Miss Ellen Terry's Lady Macbeth, immortalised
by Sargent! But there was no attempt in those
days to give the audiences anything better. When
Benjamin West asked Garrick why he did not
initiate reform in stage-costume, his answer was
that the public would not allow it. "They would
throw a bottle at my head," added the great actor,
and he found it easier to elude the bottle&mdash;at least,
that particular bottle.</p>

<p>I believe it is to John Kemble we are indebted
for the first careful study of dressing a part on its
merits, even though he did not allow himself too
near an approach to accuracy, lest, as he said, the
public should call him in disgust "an antiquary."
So he did not hesitate, in playing Macbeth, to wear
a great bonnet of the 42nd Highlanders&mdash;the
Black Watch. But when Sir Walter Scott saw
this, he was so shocked at the anachronism that he
plucked out the big plume and replaced it with
a single broad eagle's feather, the time-honoured
symbol of the Highland chieftain.</p>

<p>It was, however, to the antiquarian researches
of R. J. Planch√©, for Charles Kemble's production
of <cite>King John</cite> at Covent Garden in 1823, that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
stage owes its first important step in the reform of
costume. Macready, who urged the reform still
further, carried his sense of the importance of
costume to such a point during the rehearsals of
<cite>Henry V.</cite> that he went to bed in his armour,
desiring that, not only should the dress become
the part, but he should become the dress. I
recollect Sir Henry Irving quoting this fact, when
telling me that he himself always followed the
practice of wearing the clothes for a new part a
few days previous to assuming them on the stage.</p>

<p>Sir Henry was, of course, a past master in the
art of theatrical costume, and to his genius and
taste more than to any other influence we may
attribute its present development on the English
stage.</p>

<p>Let the old playgoer prate enthusiastically as
he will about Charles Kean, and his splendid
Shakespearean revivals at the Princess's Theatre,
dramatic art has never been more picturesquely,
richly, and appropriately clothed than it was at
the Lyceum Theatre in the great days of Henry
Irving. Even to talk to him of his productions
was a liberal education in all arts appertaining to
the theatre. That the great actor took infinite
personal trouble with every detail, and would, in
his own costume, direct the cut of the drapery,
the shape of the shirt collar, and the exact position
of the sash, or the fold of the turban, all who were
privileged to associate with him at work are fully
aware. I recall many conversations with him on
the subject of stage costume, and invariably he
would bring out some point of its psychological
bearing. As to variation in the interpretation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
a character under the influence of a different dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
for instance, I remember his saying&mdash;"When you
have the good fortune to act with an actress like
Miss Terry, the artist dominates the woman under
any conditions of costume, and the least suggestion
is easily grasped and appreciated. In all times,
modes and manners must influence each other, and
different gestures inevitably accompany different
costumes. You would not, for instance, see a lady
when wearing Grecian draperies disport herself in
the same fashion as one bearing the stiff stomacher
and monstrous farthingale of the Elizabethan
period."</p>

</div>

<p>Again, we were discussing the question of
colour in relation to certain emotions, moods, and
traits of character. "Who would think of playing
a murderer in sky-blue satin and silver?" Sir Henry
said. And not pausing for my reply: "Of course
one expects a woman to go mad in white. Can
you picture Hamlet in colours? Surely he demands
black clothes, indeed the text says as much,&mdash;although
the colour for the expression of mourning
in Denmark at that period was, I believe, red."</p>

<p>But, after all, the first thing is, or should be, to
fit the personality to the character, and then the
question of dress is comparatively easy. John
Ryder, by the way, used to explain his protracted
engagement with Charles Kean as being solely due
to what he was wont to call his "arch√¶ological"
figure.</p>

<p>It has been questioned whether the public
cares, or knows, much about the details of stage
dress, upon which so much time and thought are
bestowed; but then it is recognised that amongst
the neglected arts is the art of costume, and pending
the establishment of the Royal Academy of Dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
over which, of course, Mr. Percy Anderson should
preside, visits to the theatre may offer to the
student considerable instruction. In other days the
scholar resented any incongruities of stage-costume.
The satire of Pope pictures them vividly in the
early eighteenth century:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Such is the shout, the long applauding note,</div>
  <div class="i0">At Quin's high plume, or Oldfield's petticoat!</div>
  <div class="i0">Or when from Court a birthday suit bestowed,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load.</div>
  <div class="i0">Booth enters&mdash;Hark! the universal peal!</div>
  <div class="i0">But has he spoken? Not a syllable.</div>
  <div class="i0">What shook the stage, and made the people stare?</div>
  <div class="i0">Cato's long wig, flowered gown, and lacquered chair.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Imagine an ancient Roman in a periwig and
flowered gown after the Queen Anne fashion! No
wonder Addison, as he sat in a side box with two
or three friends to watch his tragedy on the first
night, needed flasks of Burgundy and champagne
to support his spirits, for had he not pleaded in a
number of the <cite>Spectator</cite> for the poet against the
costumier? "The ordinary method of making
a hero is to clap a huge plume of feathers on his
head, which rises so very high that there is often a
greater length from his chin to the top of his
head than to the sole of his foot.... As these
superfluous ornaments make a great man, a princess
gradually receives her grandeur from those additional
encumbrances which fall into her tail. I mean the
broad sweeping train which follows her in all her
motions, and forms constant employment for a boy
who stands behind her to open and spread to
advantage. I do not know how others are affected
at this sight, but I must confess my eyes are wholly
taken up with the page's part, and, as for the Queen,
I am not so attentive to anything she speaks as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the right adjusting of her train, lest it should
chance to trip up her heels, or incommode her as
she walks to and fro upon the stage. It is, in my
opinion, a very odd spectacle to see a Queen venting
her passions in a disordered motion, and a little boy
all the while taking care they do not ruffle the tail
of her gown. The parts that the two persons act
on the stage at the same time are very different.
The princess is afraid lest she should incur the
displeasure of the King her father, or lose the hero
her lover, whilst her attendant is only concerned
lest she should entangle her feet in her petticoat....
In short, I would have our conception raised
by the dignity of thought and sublimity of expression,
rather than by a train of robes or plume of
feathers."</p>

<p>But here was no plea for correctness of costume,
which might have obviated the distractions complained
of. Nowadays we have altered all that,
and indeed we had one modern play, <cite>Frocks and
Frills</cite>, frankly devoted to dress as the pivot of
its plot. Yet its author, Mr. Grundy, never gives
any very special instructions in the matter of
costume, his stage directions being very simple,
merely stating whether a woman should be
handsomely or poorly dressed. He declares,
however, that directly he sees the players ready
and "made up," he can realise whether or not his
work is going to be successful, feeling that if they
have realised the personalities, and look like the
men and women he has conceived, they will
represent the characters convincingly. He audaciously
advances the dogma, that every woman is
at heart a fashion-plate, and I wish I could set
him down for serious conversion by Mrs. Tree, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
amongst the few whose taste in dress on the stage
is quite irreproachable, who never makes a mistake
in fitting her clothes to her part.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tree vows that if you gave her a dozen
yards of white cr√™pe de chine, she would make a
costume in which she could appear as Ophelia,
Lady Macbeth, Constance, and Juliet, and would
undertake in the disposal of her draperies to satisfy
the demands of the most exacting critic. But on
the subject of fashion Mrs. Tree is a heretic,
refusing to treat it seriously, and indulging in the
theory that "everything is people, nothing is
gowns." The philosophy of clothes as expounded
by Mrs. Tree, if rendered popular, would not bring
much grist to the mill of the modiste; but then
"In this life nothing comes off&mdash;except buttons"
is her favourite pessimism.</p>

<p>I have heard a famous dramatist declare that
when he wants to mark a situation strongly upon
the minds of the audience, he never allows the
heroine to make entry in a new frock. He also
contended that, in choosing her own gown, the
actress should choose it in relation to those to be
worn by other players appearing in the same scene,
regarding herself, not primarily as an individual but
as one in a group. She should also take care that
her dress is suited not only to her surroundings but
to her "business," so that no drapery impede her
movements, no tightness be a bar to graceful gesture.</p>

<p>No less an authority than Mr. Pinero, when
discussing the influence that dress may exercise on
the art of acting, has declared that our plays are
for the most part over-dressed, with extravagance,
vulgarity, and inappropriateness obtaining in place
of artistic fitness. It is well known that Pinero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
takes a personal interest in every detail pertaining
to his productions, and such condemnation from
him is condemnation indeed. Especially when he
caps it by saying that he has found that the new
costumes have to some extent frequently undone
the results of his undress rehearsals, the actresses no
longer representing his creations as they did before
the dressmakers sent home their gowns, while the
variety of their impersonations is swamped by the
uniformity of their fashions.</p>

<p>Even while grumbling, Pinero admits that stage
costume has made wonderful progress since the
time when Robertson's appropriately-dressed plays
doomed the theatrical stock wardrobe, and Alfred
Thompson initiated reforms making for artistic
harmony; nevertheless, Pinero protests that it is
time for the dramatist, in the interests of dramatic
art, to say to the costumiers and the purveyors of
fashion, "Thus far shall ye go, and no farther."</p>

<p>Sir James Linton took up this cry, while
declaring that the bane of the dressmaker was over
all feminine stage costume, and would be, until
there arose an autocratic manager. Sir James is
severe, and would accept no compromise, insisting
that dress in historical plays should be absolutely
accurate, quite regardless of the becoming, and
asserting that an element of incongruity is always
present on the stage, introduced by the mere vanity
of the mere woman.</p>

<p>In how far the art of costume may affect the
art of drama I have my pet theories, which include
a predilection in favour of red of all shades for
historical dress; an appreciation of the charm of
decoration in black and gold; a recognition of the
immense value of black in small quantities wisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
disposed, and much sympathy with trimmings of black and white on
light dress of modern fashion. Combinations of colour which in
ordinary circumstances would appear at least daring, and, at the most,
unpleasant, have a knack of being effective when worn on the stage. The
deep crimson lining to the scarlet cloak may be quoted as an example of
this, together with the alliance of emerald green with turquoise blue,
and orange colour with lemon. On fairies and other angels of the ballet
the repetition of the same costume is of great value, the multiplied
mass enchaining the eye, where smaller groups of diverse details fail
to hold it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GEORGE ALEXANDER AS GUY DOMVILLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In moments of passionate emotion it is well that the actor or
actress should discard a hat. Irving rarely wore one at all, invariably
taking the first opportunity to remove his, bearing it with his special
grace under his arm or in his hand, as opportunity permitted.</p>

<p>In the management of classic drapery consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>able
skill and much practice are demanded, and
many an actor of contemporary methods finds
himself lost and awkward without the consoling
comfort of his trouser pocket for his restless fingers,
or the convenient coat-tail to be jerked, in fits of
irritation. Undoubtedly, it is wise for the player
to accustom himself to unconventional clothes for
some days before assuming them on the stage: it is
only thus that he can hope to avoid self-consciousness
and to escape inelegance of movement and
gesture. Women, although more easily adapted
to new clothes, and less embarrassed under their
influence, because more accustomed to such
privileges, yet suffer restraint in different attire, and
would yet do well to consider the advisability of
rehearsing in their frocks on more than one occasion
before they permit these to accompany them
in their histrionic duties.</p>

<p>The stage has oftentimes had the privilege of
introducing new fashions, and the most apathetic
patron of the playhouse may be lured to the
auditorium by the report of something new in
petticoats, an ideal coiffure, or the latest modish
mandate obeyed to the letter in a belt. Miss
Violet Vanbrugh may have the credit of bringing
to notice the elegant charms of the corselet, and
the trim fascinations of the stock collar, worn with
the right sort of cravat. To Miss Mary Moore I
attribute a revived popularity of the broad black
Alsatian bow; she wore this in velvet in her
clever impersonation in <cite>Mrs. Gorringe's Necklace</cite>,
and all the world of women flocked to see
and to copy; while her little short-waisted white
muslin frock, with broad ribbons and puffed sleeves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
in <cite>Rosemary</cite> made that heroine an inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
figure at fancy-dress balls for months after the
production of this dainty little play. Miss Letty
Lind, Miss Kate Vaughan, and Miss Jessie Milward&mdash;I
take my examples at random&mdash;may all
be counted pioneers. To Kate Vaughan we owe
the lace-frilled petticoat, beneath the influence of
which she daintily danced her way into public
favour. Miss Letty Lind first wore the accordion-pleated
dancing skirt, and Miss Jessie Milward
popularised the lawn-embroidered collars and cuffs.
I forget which Adelphi melodrama she graced with
these trifles, but I am safe in asserting that she was
the heroine of the drama, and was made happy by
wedding bells as the curtain fell.</p>

<p>It is easy for me to let my pictures in this
chapter give me my cues for dilating on specially
splendid productions which it has been my privilege
to enjoy, for Mr. Anderson has been responsible for
the majority of these, and his pencil has illuminated
the various centuries with experience, infinite care,
and a skill of which I have promised him faithfully
not to speak.</p>

<p>An exception, however, was <cite>Coriolanus</cite> at the
Lyceum, a play lending itself pre-eminently to
dignified interpretation, and it is needless to say that
Sir Henry Irving saw that it got this. Perhaps
the great actor never looked more imposing than
in the military robes of dull red and leopard skins,
with a cuirass of richly-wrought gold, though, to
be sure, he always wore his ecclesiastical garb with
the grand air, and as Wolsey, Richelieu, and
Becket he embodied the venerable magnificence of
established holiness.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>BEERBOHM TREE AS MALVOLIO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Miss Ellen Terry, as Volumnia, also personified
dignity, whether in a loose garb of purple silk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
with a mantle of yellow and brown falling from a
diadem-shaped head-dress set with turquoise, or
when, after her successful pleading with her son,
she threw aside her garb of woeful black, and was
radiant in a draped tunic embroidered in pink and
gold, with gold ornaments round her arms and
turquoise chains upon her neck.</p>

<p>The picture of Rome under Nero, Mr. Tree
personally invested with a purposeful effeminacy,
and his tunics and garlands of flowers accentuated
the poet in the man. Mrs. Tree showed Agrippina
at her best beneath the influence of many-coloured
veils, violet and red being the dominant notes; and
two gracious pictures rise before my eyes as I write,
of Miss Constance Collier as Popp√¶a in white,
with a thick wreath of scarlet poppies around her
dusky head, and of Miss Dorothea Baird in peach
colour, with lilacs entwined in her fair hair.</p>

</div>

<p>Amongst other notable figures which dwell in
my memory is Miss Lily Hanbury as Chorus in
<cite>Henry V.</cite>, produced by Lewis Waller, whose mien
in armour, bearing a fine cloak lined with Venetian
red, breathed the essential spirit of martial force.
Miss Hanbury looked wonderful in draperies of
brilliant red over white, standing on a pedestal
against a black background. And the secret of the
admirable conduct of her folds was that the white
under-dress of cr√™pe de chine was wrung when
wet, and round this were wound seventeen yards
of blood-red cr√™pe. With this splendid triumph
of personality Miss Hanbury may class her appearance
as Lady Blessington in Mr. Tree's production,
<cite>The Last of the Dandies</cite>, when she appeared in a
pale-blue satin gown, very full round the waist,
with a white chiffon double-frilled fichu over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
shoulders, and a bonnet bearing a lace veil pendent
over the back, and clusters of pink roses resting
beneath the brim in front. <cite>The Last of the Dandies</cite>
was, as it should have been, quite a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">succ√®s de costume</i>,
and it may be written down under this aspect to
the credit of Percy Anderson.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>MISS CONSTANCE COLLIER AS VIOLA.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This reminds me of the illustrations which
adorn this chapter. Firstly, of George Alexander
in <cite>Guy Domville</cite>, that subtly clever play by Henry
James, which came before its time and died of
its premature birth. Sombre black is the dress
chosen by this English Protestant gentleman about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
to take holy orders in the latter part of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In <cite>Ulysses</cite> the costumes were in form and
colour essentially primitive, archaic indeed, and
no less a compliment has been bestowed on Mr.
Anderson's work in this direction than the proposition
that the designs should be acquired by the
British Museum. The sketch of Julian l'Estrange
as Hermes may be taken as typical; gold and black
and red expressed it, and there were red wings to
the cap and sandals to the feet.</p>

<p>As Malvolio Mr. Tree excelled all his predecessors.
Even the old playgoer yielded his
admiration to the fantastic charms of this egotist,
who displayed just the right touch of absurdity in
every gesture, in every inflection of his voice, and
in every detail of his clothes, who was so elegant
with his elongated stick, and his blade-green and
yellow slashed dress with its monster ruff and
foppish frills.</p>

<p>Miss Constance Collier as Viola wore a dress
of grey embroidered with silver, the cap of scarlet
tossing a blue tassel, while her pouch of crimson
velvet embroidered with gold had peculiar slits or
pockets for weapons, and her sleeves hung wing-like
in exact copy of the Albanian costume, a happy
idea, since the Illyria of Shakespeare is the Albania
of to-day.</p>

<p>Desdemona, as played by Miss Gertrude Elliot
in Forbes Robertson's production of <cite>Othello</cite> at the
Lyceum Theatre, was a sweet and dainty creature
indeed, wearing the palest of colours, white, pale
blue and silver, and gold, with a trellis of pearls on
her fair head, and ribbons and pearls entwined in
her flowing locks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>V√©ronique</cite>, the first of a new series of comic
operas with a plot, was remarkable altogether for
its exquisite frocks. No prettier harmony could
have been imagined than the chrysoprase-green
and white of the first act, unless it be the many
gradations of pink, cerise, and red which graced the
last act in company with a little band of maidens
clad in pale-lemon colour. The picture of
V√©ronique shows her with the close lace cap
threaded with little green ribbons, and with short
soft glac√© sacque trimmed with ribbons, and this
she wore in the famous swing scene, where the
daintiest of little early Victorian brides danced in
white muslin and a poke bonnet under the shade of
pink and white chestnut trees.</p>

<p>The Othello of my picture is wearing a dress of
thick woollen fabric in deep cream tone; his head
is bound with a white turban, in which greenly
glistens a huge emerald, emeralds being embroidered
on the sleeves interspersed with a design of red silk;
and there are jewels of all colours encrusted in his
sword-belt, and his sash is of red cashmere fringed
with red and green.</p>

<p>It is invidious to make comparisons&mdash;I have
heard this for many years, and known it even longer&mdash;yet
I would boldly declare that there are but few
ladies upon the stage who understand the important
fact that, by the dressing of the hair and the
decoration of the head, they may make or mar the
most gorgeous or most simple garment. Miss
Ellen Terry and Mrs. Tree share a talent for
historical head-dressing, whilst of the younger
generation Miss Dorothea Baird and Miss Lily
Brayton most justly deserve the palm of excellence
for the way they express their sense of period in the
arrangement of their tresses, and will dismiss all
hankerings after the merely becoming in the
higher interests of the entirely appropriate.</p>

<p>The most interesting actresses of to-day make a
cult of costume, and are ever ready with views,
theories, and even predilections. Miss Irene
Vanbrugh, for example, who, with her sister, Miss
Violet Vanbrugh, would seem to interpret all that
is fashionable on the stage, and to speak materially
the last word of modern style, quite unlike
Miss Baird, who pleads for the lines of nature and
would kill fashion, frankly declares her favourite
stage costume was the kimono in which she
played that exciting scene in <cite>The Gay Lord
Quex</cite>. Her experience of the crinoline period in
<cite>Trelawny of the Wells</cite>, with the frilled skirts, pork-pie
hats, and the hair-nets, led Miss Vanbrugh to
be thankful that in real life she had escaped
fashions "so detestably uncomfortable."</p>

<p>Another typically elegant actress is Miss Ellis
Jeffries, and her personal taste inclines towards the
plainest and simplest costumes, as she told me,
while adding, "Of course you won't believe me,
but it's true. I choose my frocks to suit my
circumstances on the stage, and also to some extent
the emotions I have to express; and I insisted, in
spite of criticism, that, when I had to play the part
of an hysterical woman, I should robe her in
scarlet. I felt I couldn't be hysterical in white
muslin; could you?"</p>

<p>Miss Marie Tempest, exploiting to perfection
the sartorial possibilities of <cite>Peg Woffington</cite>, made
her first appearance in that play in a dress of
daffodil yellow with pointed bodice outlined with
sable, the skirt trimmed with sable, and a lace cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
fitting closely to her powdered head. She was
amazingly hooped and paniered, and looked her
most gorgeous in the second act, in a dress of
white satin flounced with silver lace, profusely
ornamented with ruches and rosettes of pink
chiffon. A scarf of silver tissue was draped across
the front of the skirt, a knot of black velvet decked
the low bodice, and a fascinating little black feather
nodded on one side of the head.</p>

<p>Again, as Becky Sharp, Miss Marie Tempest
showed her nice sense of the fitness of things,
gracing the historic ball on the eve of Waterloo in
pink chiffon with clusters of roses, and choosing a
Court gown of Empire tendency, made with a
white satin train lined with cloth of gold, and
embroidered in a leaf design of gold, which also
appeared across the bust and on the hem of
the chiffon under-skirt.</p>

<p>Yet Miss Tempest avowedly does not believe
that the actress should subordinate her personality
in any way to a general scheme. Discussing the
question, she said: "I think that designers of
theatrical costume as a rule are altogether oblivious
of the special requirements of individual faces and
figures. To the designer, it seems to me, the
actress is merely a note of colour in his general
scheme. Only that, and nothing more! I would
urge that exactly the same kind of costume cannot
possibly be becoming alike to tall, majestic women
and a little insignificant <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nez retrouss√©</i> person like
me! I cannot afford to have two or three lines
going across my figure and cutting me up into
slices; nor can I have my neck muffled and ruffled
up to the eyes, and my shoulders loaded with
heavy cloaks, without feeling perfectly swamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and overwhelmed&mdash;and looking it, which is worse!
I always think," she concluded, "that a woman
ought to have a large share in the designing and
arranging of stage-dresses, for she can understand
what is becoming far better than a man. Small
matters of detail are carried out better by women
than by men. And women, of course, have more
patience and more perseverance."</p>

<p>But theatrical costume is a subject for a whole
volume, not for a chapter merely, and I can touch
but the fringe of it. I have felt tempted to dwell
upon the past, and endeavour to trace the evolution
of the idea of accurate costume on the stage
from the day, perhaps, when the celebrated Mrs.
Mattocks of Covent Garden copied the attire of
Rubens's second wife in Vandyck's picture, so as to
appear appropriately as the niece of the Governor
of Bruges, in <cite>The Royal Merchant</cite>, a play adapted
from Beaumont and Fletcher. But, lacking
the pen of the historian and the science of the
psychologist, I have chosen the easier and more
humble role of the gossip. Yet, perhaps, the
elusive chatter of the actress's dressing-room may
not be without its suggestive value, more vivid,
possibly, than the utterings of the student, for its
memories have the fragrance of yesterday. Before
me as I write, secure under glass, together with its
authentic pedigree, is the lace collar that Edmund
Kean used to wear when he played Hamlet; yet it
stirs no thrill in me because of Kean, as old Sir
William Gower, in Pinero's <cite>Trelawny of the Wells</cite>,
was moved at sight of the chain Kean wore as
Richard, because in his youth he had seen the
great actor. But the mere thought of the soft lawn
collar and cuffs that H. B. Irving wore with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
"inky cloak," gold-bordered and crimson-lined, and
his famous father's silver-clasped belt, brings the
latest and not the least accomplished of Hamlets
vividly to my mind's eye. Each tone, gesture,
action, falls naturally into a harmony of memory,
because the costume was as appropriate as it was
picturesquely charming&mdash;in fact, it was right, which
proves the truth of Sir Henry Irving's doctrine,
"You can take it that the right thing on the stage
is at once the most effective and the most becoming."
A wise doctrine, which may be applied
with irrefutable truth to the art of costume on
and off the boards&mdash;a doctrine which may obtain
as guidance through the land of dress in all the
centuries, under all circumstances, past and to
come.</p>
